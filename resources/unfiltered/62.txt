SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, all references to “FIS,” “we,” the “Company” or the “registrant” are to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its subsidiaries.(1) Basis of PresentationThe unaudited financial information included in this report includes the accounts of FIS and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. All adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  This report should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2017 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) to conform to the classifications used in 2018.  Amounts in tables in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes may not sum due to rounding. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018.  As a result, all 2017 financial information has been adjusted for the implementation of Topic 606.We report the results of our operations in three reporting segments: Integrated Financial Solutions (“IFS”), Global Financial Solutions (“GFS”) and Corporate and Other (Note 13).  (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies(a) Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates revenues in a number of ways, including from the delivery of account- or transaction-based processing, software as a service ("SaaS"), business process as a service ("BPaaS"), cloud offerings, software licensing, software related services, and professional services. The Company enters into arrangements with customers to provide services, software and software-related services such as maintenance, implementation and training either individually or as part of an integrated offering of multiple services.  At contract inception, the Company assesses the solutions and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - i.e., if a solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.  To identify its performance obligations, the Company considers all of the solutions or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices.  The Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to a customer.Revenue is measured based on the consideration that the Company expects to receive in a contract with a customer.  The Company’s contracts with its customers frequently contain variable consideration.  Variable consideration exists when the amount which the Company expects to receive in a contract is based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events, such as processing services performed under usage-based pricing arrangements or professional services billed on a time and materials basis.  Variable consideration is also present in certain transactions in the form of discounts, credits, price concessions, penalties, and similar items.  If the amount of a discount or rebate in a contract is fixed and not contingent, that discount or rebate is not variable consideration.  The Company estimates variable consideration in its contracts primarily using the expected value method.  In some contracts, the Company applies the most likely amount method by considering the single most likely amount in a limited range of possible consideration amounts.  The Company develops estimates of variable  7Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)consideration on the basis of both historical information and current trends.  Variable consideration included in the transaction price is constrained such that a significant revenue reversal is not probable. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue.  Postage costs associated with print and mail services are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of revenues.Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings.  We are often responsible for billing the client in these arrangements and transmitting the applicable fees to the third party.  The Company determines whether it is responsible for providing the actual solution or service as a principal, or for arranging for the solution or service to be provided by the third party as an agent.  Judgment is applied to determine whether we are the principal or the agent by evaluating whether the Company has control of the solution or service prior to it being transferred to the customer.  The principal versus agent assessment is performed at the performance obligation level.  Indicators that the Company considers in determining if it has control include whether the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified solution or service to the customer, the Company has inventory risk and the Company has discretion in establishing the price the customer ultimately pays for the solution or service.  Depending upon the level of our contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, we have arrangements where we are the principal and recognize the gross amount billed to the customer and other arrangements where we are the agent and recognize the net amount retained.    Once the Company has determined the transaction price, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in a manner depicting the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the solution(s) or service(s) to the customer (the “allocation objective”).  If the allocation objective is met at contractual prices, no allocations are made.  Otherwise, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis, except when the criteria are met for allocating variable consideration or a discount to one or more, but not all performance obligations in the contract.  The Company allocates variable consideration to one or more, but not all performance obligations when the terms of the variable payment relate specifically to the Company’s efforts to satisfy the performance obligation (or transfer the distinct solution or service) and when such allocation is consistent with the allocation objective when considering all performance obligations in the contract. Determining whether the criteria for allocating variable consideration to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in the contract requires significant judgment and may affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized. The Company does not typically meet the requirements to allocate discounts to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in a contract.In order to determine the standalone selling price of its promised solutions or services, the Company conducts a regular analysis to determine whether various solutions or services have an observable standalone selling price.  If the Company does not have an observable standalone selling price for a particular solution or service, then standalone selling price for that particular solution or service is estimated using all information that is reasonably available and maximizing observable inputs with approaches including historical pricing, cost plus a margin, adjusted market assessment, and residual approach.The following describes the nature of the Company’s primary types of revenues and the revenue recognition policies and significant payment terms as they pertain to the types of transactions the Company enters into with its customers.Processing Services RevenuesProcessing services are primarily comprised of data processing and application management, including our SaaS, BPaaS, and cloud offerings. Revenues from processing services are typically volume- or activity-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, transactions or trades processed, users, number of hours of services or computer resources used. The payment terms may include tiered pricing structures with the base tier representing a minimum monthly usage fee. Pricing within the tiers typically resets on a monthly basis and minimum monthly volumes are generally met or exceeded. Contract lengths for processing services typically span multiple years.  Payment is generally due in advance or in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis and may include fixed or variable payment amounts depending on the specific payment terms and activity in the period. For processing services revenues, the nature of the Company’s promise to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to the Company’s processing platforms and perform an unspecified quantity of outsourced and transaction-processing services for a specified term or terms.  Accordingly, processing services are generally viewed as a stand-ready performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services.  The Company typically satisfies its processing services  8Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)performance obligations over time as the services are provided.  A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress because the Company’s efforts are expended evenly throughout the period given the nature of the promise is a stand-ready service.  The Company has evaluated its variable payment terms related to its processing services revenues accounted for as a series of distinct days of service and concluded that they generally meet the criteria for allocating variable consideration entirely to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in a contract.  Accordingly, when the criteria are met, variable amounts based on the number and type of services performed during a period are allocated to and recognized on the day in which the Company performs the related services.  Fixed fees for processing services are generally recognized ratably over the contract period.License and Software Related RevenuesThe Company’s software licenses generally have significant stand-alone functionality to the customer upon delivery and are considered to be functional intellectual property (“IP”).  Additionally, the nature of the Company’s promise in granting these software licenses to a customer is typically to provide the customer a right to use the Company’s intellectual property.  The Company’s software licenses are generally considered distinct performance obligations, and revenue allocated to the software license is typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license.In conjunction with software licenses, the Company commonly provides the customer with additional services such as maintenance as well as associated implementation and other professional services related to the software license.  Payments for maintenance are typically due annually, quarterly, or monthly in advance.  Maintenance is typically comprised of technical support and unspecified updates and upgrades. The Company generally satisfies these performance obligations evenly using a time-elapsed output method over the contract term given there is no discernible pattern of performance.  When a software license contract also includes professional services that provide significant modification or customization of the software license, the Company combines the software license and professional services into a single performance obligation, and revenue for the combined performance obligation is recognized as the professional services are provided consistent with the methods described above for professional services revenues. The Company has contracts where the licensed software is offered in conjunction with hosting services.  The licensed software may be considered a separate performance obligation from the hosting services if the customer can take possession of the software during the contractual term without incurring a significant penalty and if it is feasible for the customer to run the software on its own infrastructure or hire a third party to host the software.  If the licensed software and hosting services are separately identifiable, license revenues are recognized when the hosting services commence and it is within the customer's control to obtain a copy of the software, and hosting revenues are recognized using the time-elapsed output method as the service is provided.  If the software license is not separately identifiable from the hosting service, then the related revenues for the combined performance obligation are recognized ratably over the hosting period. Occasionally, the Company offers extended payment terms on its license transactions and evaluates whether any potential significant financing components exist.  For certain of its business units, the Company will provide a software license through a rental model for customers who would prefer a periodic fee instead of a larger up-front payment.  Revenue recognition under these arrangements follows the same recognition pattern as the arrangements outlined above; however, the customer generally pays for the software license and maintenance in monthly or quarterly installments as opposed to an upfront software license fee.  Judgment is required to determine whether these arrangements contain a significant financing component.  The Company evaluates whether there is a significant difference between the amount of promised consideration over the rental term and the cash selling price of the software license, and the overall impact of the time value of money on the transaction.  Rental software license arrangements that include a significant financing component are adjusted for the time value of money at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate by recording a contract asset and interest income.  The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if it is expected, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised solution or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that solution or service will be one year or less.Professional Services RevenuesProfessional services revenues are comprised of implementation, conversion, and programming services associated with the Company’s data processing and application management agreements, implementation or installation services related to licensed software, and other consulting services.  A significant portion of our professional services revenues are derived from contracts for dedicated personnel resources who are often working full-time at a client site and under the client's direction.  These  9Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)revenues generally re-occur as contracts are renewed.  Payment terms for professional services may be based on an upfront fixed fee, fixed upon the achievement of milestones, or on a time and materials basis.In assessing whether implementation services provided on data processing, application management or software agreements are a distinct performance obligation, the Company considers whether the services are both capable of being distinct (i.e., can the customer benefit from the services alone or in combination with other resources that are readily available to the customer) and distinct within the context of the contract (i.e., separately identifiable from the other performance obligations in the contract).  Implementation services and other professional services are typically considered distinct performance obligations. However, when these services involve significant customization or modification of an underlying solution or offering, or if the services are complex and not available from a third-party provider and must be completed prior to a customer having the ability to benefit from a solution or offering, then such services and the underlying solution or offering will be accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The Company’s professional services that are accounted for as distinct performance obligations and that are billed on a fixed fee basis are typically satisfied as services are rendered; thus the Company uses a cost-based input method, such as cost-to-cost or efforts expended (labor hours), to provide a faithful depiction of the transfer of those services.  For professional services that are distinct and billed on a time and materials basis, revenue is generally recognized using an output method that corresponds with the time and materials billed and delivered, which is reflective of the transfer of the services to the customer.  Professional services that are not distinct from an associated solution or offering are recognized over the common measure of progress for the overall performance obligation (typically a time-elapsed output measure that corresponds to the period over which the solution or offering is made available to the customer). Hardware and Other RevenuesHardware and other miscellaneous revenues are generally recognized at a point in time upon delivery.  The Company typically does not stock in inventory the hardware solutions sold but arranges for delivery of hardware from third-party suppliers.  The Company determines whether hardware delivered from third-party suppliers should be recognized on a gross or net basis by evaluating whether the Company has control of the solution or service prior to it being transferred to the customer.Material RightsSome of the Company’s contracts with customers include options for the customer to acquire additional solutions or services in the future, including options to renew existing services.  Options may represent a material right to acquire solutions or services if the discount is incremental to the range of discounts typically given for those solutions or services to that class of customer in that geographical area or market, and the customer would not have obtained the option without entering into the contract.  If deemed to be a material right, the Company will account for the material right as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on directly observable prices when available.  If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, then the Company estimates the standalone selling price to be equal to the discount that the customer would obtain by exercising the option, as adjusted for any discount that the customer would receive without exercising the option and for the likelihood that the option will be exercised.(b) Deferred Contract CostsThe Company incurs costs as a result of both the origination and fulfillment of our contracts with customers.  Origination costs relate primarily to the payment of sales commissions that are directly related to sales transactions.  Fulfillment costs include the cost of implementation services related to SaaS and other cloud-based arrangements when the implementation service is not distinct from the ongoing service.  When origination costs and fulfillment costs that will be used to satisfy future performance obligations are directly related to the execution of our contracts with customers, and the costs are recoverable under the contract, the costs are capitalized as a deferred contract cost. Origination costs for contracts that contain a distinct software license recognized at a point in time are allocated between the license and all other performance obligations of the contract and amortized according to the pattern of performance for the respective obligations.  Otherwise, origination costs are capitalized as a single asset for each contract and amortized using an appropriate single measure of performance considering all of the performance obligations in the contract.  The Company amortizes origination costs over the expected benefit period to which the deferred contract cost relates.  Origination costs related to initial contracts with a customer are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the solution or the expected  10Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)customer relationship period.  Commissions paid on renewals are amortized over the renewal period.  Capitalized fulfillment costs are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the solution or the expected customer relationship period.(3) Changes in Accounting PoliciesThe Company adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition. The details of the significant changes and quantitative impact of the changes are disclosed below.The Company applied Topic 606 retrospectively using certain practical expedients in paragraph 606-10-65-1(f). For completed contracts that have variable consideration, the Company used the transaction price at the date the contract was completed rather than estimating variable consideration amounts in the comparative reporting periods. Further, the Company did not disclose the amount of consideration allocated to the remaining performance obligations or an explanation of when the Company expects to recognize that amount as revenue for the 2017 interim reporting periods presented before the date of the initial application. Lastly, the Company did not retrospectively restate contracts modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented but reflects the aggregate effect of all modifications that occurred before the beginning of the earliest period presented.Principal vs. Agent ConsiderationsIn customer transactions that also involve third parties, the Company determines whether it is responsible for providing the ultimate solution or service as a principal, or whether it is merely arranging for the solution or service to be provided by the third party as an agent. When the Company is acting as a principal in a transaction, the Company recognizes the gross amounts billed as revenue. When the Company is acting as an agent in a transaction, the Company recognizes the net amount retained as revenue. Previously, the Company followed the guidance of Topic 605, which lists eight specific indicators that are determinative in evaluating whether a contract is recorded on a gross or a net basis. Under Topic 606, the determination is based on whether an entity obtains control of goods or services prior to transfer to a customer. The Company determined interchange and third-party network fees associated with certain parts of the payment processing business were significantly impacted by the adoption of Topic 606. Previously, gross accounting applied to certain types of these transactions, depending on the specific facts and circumstances. However, under Topic 606 revenues from these arrangements will be presented on a net basis because the Company has concluded that it is acting as an agent in the transaction. Software License RentalsThe Company previously recognized revenue for initial license fees only when a contract existed, the fee was fixed or determinable, software delivery had occurred, collection was deemed probable, and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value had been established for any undelivered elements in the arrangement. If those criteria were not met, the initial license revenue was either deferred or recognized over time depending on the specific facts and circumstances. Software license rentals typically include payments that are delayed for a period of time, causing the Company to conclude that some portion of the license fee was not fixed or determinable. In these arrangements, license revenue would be deferred until payments become due and payable. Under Topic 606, the Company’s software licenses are generally considered distinct performance obligations, and revenue allocated to the software license is typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license. Software license revenue is also typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license under Topic 606 even if it is sold in a rental model or with extended payment terms, provided collectability is probable. Accordingly, a larger portion of software license revenue is recognized upfront for such transactions under Topic 606 than under Topic 605.Term License Early RenewalsThe Company previously recognized revenue for term software license renewals upon execution of a license renewal contract, provided all other revenue recognition requirements were met. Under Topic 606, revenue attributable to software term license renewals is now recognized at a later date than it would have been recognized under the previous accounting policy. 11Table of

In some cases, customers pay in advance of our delivery of solutions or services; in other cases, payment is due as services are performed or in arrears following the delivery of the solutions or services. Differences in timing between revenue recognition and invoicing result in accrued trade receivables, contract assets, or deferred revenues on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Receivables are accrued when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing but the right to payment is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required). This occurs most commonly when software term licenses recognized at a point in time are paid for periodically over the license term. Contract assets result when amounts allocated to distinct performance obligations are recognized when or as control of a solution or service is transferred to the customer but invoicing is contingent on performance of other performance obligations or  21Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)on completion of contractual milestones. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional, typically upon invoicing of the related performance obligations in the contract or upon achieving the requisite project milestone. Deferred revenues result from customer payments in advance of our satisfaction of the associated performance obligation(s) and relate primarily to prepaid maintenance or other recurring services. Deferred revenues are relieved as revenue is recognized. Contract assets and deferred revenues are reported on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the contract assets and deferred revenues balances during the six months ended June 30, 2018 were not materially impacted by any factors other than those described above. The Company recognized revenue of $170 million and $169 million during the three months and $452 million and $413 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, that was included in the corresponding deferred revenues balance at the beginning of the periods.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, amounts recognized from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in prior periods were insignificant. Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance ObligationsAs of June 30, 2018, approximately $19.5 billion of revenue is estimated to be recognized in the future from the Company’s remaining unfulfilled performance obligations, which are primarily comprised of recurring account- and volume-based processing services. This excludes the amount of anticipated recurring renewals not yet contractually obligated. The Company expects to recognize approximately 35% of our remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, approximately another 25% over the next 13 to 24 months, and the balance thereafter.(5) Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement DetailsThe following table shows the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement details as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (in millions): June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017, As adjusted Cost Accumulateddepreciation and amortization Net Cost Accumulateddepreciation and amortization NetProperty and equipment$1,675 $1,118 $557 $1,657 $1,047 $610Intangible assets$6,325 $2,801 $3,524 $6,369 $2,484 $3,885Computer software$2,956 $1,233 $1,723 $2,862 $1,134 $1,728       The Company entered into capital lease and other financing obligations of $0 million and $5 million during the three months and $0 million and $79 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The assets are included in property and equipment and computer software and the remaining obligations are classified as long-term debt on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  Periodic payments are included in repayment of borrowings on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited).

Settlement deposits represent funds we hold that were drawn from our clients to facilitate settlement activities.  Settlement receivables represent amounts funded by us.  Settlement payables consist of settlement deposits from clients, settlement payables to third parties, and outstanding checks related to our settlement activities for which the right of offset does not exist or we do not intend to exercise our right of offset.  Our accounting policy for such outstanding checks is to include them in settlement payables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) and operating cash flows on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited).         (6) Deferred Contract CostsOrigination and fulfillment costs from contracts with customers capitalized as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 consisted of the following (in millions): June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Contract costs on implementations in progress117 104Incremental contract origination costs on completed implementations, net172 127Contract fulfillment costs on completed implementations, net123 123Total deferred contract costs, net$412 $354Amortization of deferred contract costs on completed implementations was $30 million and $26 million during the three months and $58 million and $46 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and there were no impairment losses in relation to the costs capitalized for periods presented. 23Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(7) Long-Term DebtLong-term debt as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, consisted of the following (in millions): June 30, December 31, 2018 2017Senior Notes due April 2018, interest payable semi-annually at 2.000% (1)— 250Senior Notes due October 2018, interest payable semi-annually at 2.850% — 750Senior Notes due October 2020, interest payable semi-annually at 3.625% ("2020 Notes")1,150 1,150Senior Euro Notes due January 2021, interest payable annually at 0.400% ("2021 Euro Notes")584 599Senior Notes due August 2021, interest payable semi-annually at 2.250% ("2021 Notes")750 750Senior GBP Notes due June 2022, interest payable annually at 1.700% ("2022 GBP Notes")396 405Senior Notes due October 2022, interest payable semi-annually at 4.500% ("2022 Notes")300 300Senior Notes due April 2023, interest payable semi-annually at 3.500% ("2023 Notes")700 700Senior Notes due June 2024, interest payable semi-annually at 3.875% ("2024 Notes")400 400Senior Euro Notes due July 2024, interest payable annually at 1.100% ("2024 Euro Notes")584 599Senior Notes due October 2025, interest payable semi-annually at 5.000% ("2025 Notes")900 900Senior Notes due August 2026, interest payable semi-annually at 3.000% ("2026 Notes")1,250 1,250Senior Notes due May 2028, interest payable semi-annually at 4.250% ("2028 Notes")400 —Senior Notes due August 2046, interest payable semi-annually at 4.500% ("2046 Notes")500 500Senior Notes due May 2048, interest payable semi-annually at 4.750% ("2048 Notes")600 —Revolving Loan (2)410 195Other(32) 15 8,892 8,763Current portion(38) (1,045)Long-term debt, excluding current portion$8,854 $7,718(1)These Senior Notes were repaid on April 13, 2018 with borrowings on the Revolving Loan.(2)Interest on the Revolving Loan is generally payable at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up to 1.75% plus an unused commitment fee of up to 0.25%, each based upon the Company's corporate credit ratings.  As of June 30, 2018, the weighted average interest rate on the Revolving Loan, excluding fees, was 3.22%. FIS has a syndicated credit agreement (the "FIS Credit Agreement") that provides total committed capital of $3,000 million in the form of a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Loan") maturing on August 10, 2021.  As of June 30, 2018, the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan was $410 million, with $2,584 million of borrowing capacity remaining thereunder (net of $6 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Loan). The obligations of FIS under the FIS Credit Agreement and under all of its outstanding senior notes rank equal in priority and are unsecured.  The FIS Credit Agreement and the senior notes are subject to customary covenants, including, among others, limitations under the FIS Credit Agreement on the payment of dividends by FIS, and customary events of default.On March 15, 2017, FIS redeemed 100% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of its $700 million 5.000% Senior Notes due March 2022 (the "Notes").  On February 1, 2017, the Company also paid down the outstanding balance on the syndicated term loan agreement ("2018 Term Loans").  The redemption of the Notes and the repayment of the 2018 Term Loans were funded by borrowings under the Revolving Loan and cash proceeds from the sale of the Public Sector and Education business.  As a result of the redemption of the Notes and the repayment of the 2018 Term Loans, FIS incurred a pre-tax charge of approximately $25 million consisting of the call premium on the Notes and the write-off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs.On July 10, 2017, FIS issued €1,000 million and £300 million principal amount of new senior notes in an inaugural European bond offering.  The new senior notes include €500 million of Senior Notes due in 2021 that bear interest at 0.400%, £300 million of Senior Notes due in 2022 that bear interest at 1.700% and €500 million of Senior Notes due in 2024 that bear  24Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)interest at 1.100%.  Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting discounts and underwriting fees, were $1,491 million using a conversion rate of 1.12 EUR/USD and 1.27 GBP/USD. On July 25, 2017, pursuant to cash tender offers ("Tender Offers"), FIS repurchased approximately $2,000 million in aggregate principal of debt securities with a weighted average coupon of approximately 4%.  The following approximate amounts of FIS' debt securities were repurchased: $600 million of its 3.625% notes due 2020, $600 million of its 5.000% notes due 2025, $200 million of its 4.500% notes due 2022, $300 million of its 3.875% notes due 2024 and $300 million of its 3.500% notes due 2023.  The Company funded the Tender Offers with proceeds from the European bond offering and borrowings on its Revolving Loan, approximately $469 million of which were almost immediately repaid with proceeds from the sale of a majority ownership stake in the Capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business, which was completed on July 31, 2017 (see Note 12). On May 16, 2018, FIS issued $1,000 million principal amount of new senior notes, including $400 million of Senior Notes due in 2028 that bear interest at 4.250% and $600 million of Senior Notes due in 2048 that bear interest at 4.750%.  Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting discounts and underwriting fees, were $979 million.  FIS used the proceeds to partially repay its Revolving Loan. On June 15, 2018, FIS redeemed 100% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of its $750 million 2.850% Senior Notes due October 2018.  As a result of the redemption, FIS incurred a pre-tax charge of approximately $1 million consisting of the call premium and the write-off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs.The following summarizes the aggregate maturities of our debt and capital leases on stated contractual maturities, excluding unamortized non-cash bond discounts of $42 million, as of June 30, 2018 (in millions).    Total2018 $202019 342020 1,1632021 1,7442022 696Thereafter 5,334Total principal payments 8,991Debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization (57)Total long-term debt $8,934There are no mandatory principal payments on the Revolving Loan and any balance outstanding on the Revolving Loan will be due and payable at its scheduled maturity date, which occurs at August 10, 2021. FIS may redeem the 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2021 Euro Notes, 2022 Notes, 2022 GBP Notes, 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2024 Euro Notes, 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2046 Notes and 2048 Notes at its option in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed and a make-whole amount calculated as described in the related indenture in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, provided no make-whole amount will be paid for redemptions of the 2020 Notes, the 2021 Notes, the 2021 Euro Notes and the 2022 GBP Notes during the one month prior to their maturity, the 2022 Notes during the two months prior to their maturity, the 2023 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Euro Notes, the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes during the three months prior to their maturity, and the 2046 Notes and 2048 Notes during the six months prior to their maturity.Debt issuance costs of $57 million, net of accumulated amortization, remain capitalized as of June 30, 2018, related to all of the above outstanding debt.  25Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)We monitor the financial stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis.  The lender commitments under the undrawn portions of the Revolving Loan are comprised of a diversified set of financial institutions, both domestic and international. The failure of any single lender to perform its obligations under the Revolving Loan would not adversely impact our ability to fund operations.The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated to be approximately $127 million lower than the carrying value excluding unamortized discounts as of June 30, 2018. This estimate is based on quoted prices of our senior notes and trades of our other debt in close proximity to June 30, 2018, which are considered Level 2-type measurements. This estimate is subjective in nature and involves uncertainties and significant judgment in the interpretation of current market data. Therefore, the values presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize or settle currently. (8) Financial InstrumentsAs of June 30, 2018, we had no outstanding interest rate swap transactions and no significant forward contracts. Net Investment Hedges In June 2017, the Company entered into two Euro-denominated foreign currency exchange forward contracts totaling €999 million and a GBP-denominated foreign currency exchange forward contract of £298 million, which were designated as a net investment hedge of its investment in Euro and GBP denominated operations, respectively, in order to reduce the volatility in the income statement caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro and GBP with respect to the U.S. dollar.   In July 2017, the forward contracts above were terminated and the Company designated its Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2021 (€500 million) and Senior Notes due 2024 (€500 million) and GBP-denominated Senior Notes due 2022 (£300 million) as a net investment hedge of its investment in Euro and GBP denominated operations, respectively, in order to reduce the volatility in the income statement caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro and GBP with respect to the U.S. dollar. The change in fair value of the net investment hedges due to remeasurement of the effective portion is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The ineffective portion of the hedging instruments impacts net income when the ineffectiveness occurs. During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018, net investment hedge combined gains of $67 million and $28 million, net of tax, respectively, were recognized in other comprehensive income as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments.  No ineffectiveness was recorded on the net investment hedges above.(9) Commitments and ContingenciesReliance Trust ClaimsReliance Trust Company (“Reliance”), the Company’s subsidiary, is named as a defendant in a class action arising out of its provision of services as the discretionary trustee for a 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) for one of its customers.  Plaintiffs in the action seek damages and attorneys’ fees, as well as equitable relief, on behalf of Plan participants for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and prohibited transactions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  The action also makes claims against the Plan's sponsor and record-keeper.  Reliance is vigorously defending the action and believes that it has meritorious defenses.  Pre-trial discovery has now been completed.  Reliance contends that no breaches of fiduciary duty or prohibited transactions occurred and that the Plan suffered no damages.  Plaintiffs allege damages of approximately $125 million.  While we are unable at this time to estimate more precisely the potential loss or range of loss because of unresolved questions of fact and law, we believe that the ultimate resolution of the matter will not have a material impact on our financial condition.  We do not believe a liability for this action is probable and, therefore, have not recorded a liability for this action.Brazilian Tax Authorities ClaimsIn 2004, Proservvi Empreendimentos e Servicos, Ltda., the predecessor to Fidelity National Servicos de Tratamento de Documentos e Informatica Ltda. (“Servicos”), a subsidiary of Fidelity National Participacoes Ltda., our former item processing and remittance services operation in Brazil, acquired certain assets and employees and leased certain facilities from the Transpev Group (“Transpev”) in Brazil.  Transpev’s remaining assets were later acquired by Prosegur, an unrelated third party.  26Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)When Transpev discontinued its operations after the asset sale to Prosegur, it had unpaid federal taxes and social contributions owing to the Brazilian tax authorities.  The Brazilian tax authorities brought a claim against Transpev and beginning in 2012 brought claims against Prosegur and Servicos on the grounds that Prosegur and Servicos were successors in interest to Transpev.  To date, the Brazilian tax authorities filed 11 claims against Servicos asserting potential tax liabilities of approximately $15 million.  There are potentially 25 additional claims against Transpev/Prosegur for which Servicos is named as a co-defendant or may be named, but for which Servicos has not yet been served.  These additional claims amount to approximately $56 million making the total potential exposure for all 36 claims approximately $71 million.  We do not believe a liability for these 36 total claims is probable and, therefore, have not recorded a liability for any of these claims.Acquired Contingencies (SunGard)The Company became responsible for certain contingencies which were assumed in the SunGard acquisition.  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (Unaudited) as of June 30, 2018 includes a liability of $74 million mostly related to unclaimed property examinations and tax compliance matters.Indemnifications and WarrantiesThe Company generally indemnifies its clients, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, against damages and costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, or trademark infringement associated solely with its customers' use of  the Company's software applications or services.  Historically, the Company has not made any material payments under such indemnifications, but continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and would recognize any such losses when they are estimable.  In addition, the Company warrants to customers that its software operates substantially in accordance with the software specifications.  Historically, no material costs have been incurred related to software warranties and no accruals for warranty costs have been made.(10) Related Party TransactionsCardinal HoldingsOn July 31, 2017, FIS closed on the sale of a majority ownership stake in its Capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice L.P., by and through certain funds that it manages ("CD&R").  CD&R acquired a 60% interest in the entity (Cardinal Holdings, L.P. ("Cardinal")) and FIS obtained the remaining 40% interest, in each case before equity issued to management (Note 12).  Cardinal became a related party effective July 31, 2017.Upon closing on the sale of the Capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business, FIS and Cardinal entered into a short-term Transition Services Agreement ("TSA"), whereby FIS provides various agreed upon services to Cardinal.  FIS also provides ongoing management consulting services and other services to Cardinal. Amounts transacted through these agreements were not significant to the 2018 and 2017 periods presented.Capco continues to provide Banco Bradesco S.A. ("Banco Bradesco") with consulting services. Capco revenue and related party receivables from Banco Bradesco through the July 31, 2017 closing is included below under Brazilian Venture revenue from Banco Bradesco.Brazilian VentureThe Company operates a joint venture ("Brazilian Venture") with Banco Bradesco, in which we own a 51% controlling interest, to provide comprehensive, fully-outsourced transaction processing, call center, cardholder support and collection services to multiple card issuing clients in Brazil, including Banco Bradesco.  The original accounting for this transaction resulted in the establishment of a contract intangible asset and a liability for amounts payable to the original partner banks upon final migration of their respective card portfolios and achieving targeted volumes.  The unamortized contract intangible asset balance as of June 30, 2018 was $47 million.  The carrying value of the noncontrolling interest as of June 30, 2018 was $98 million.The Company recorded revenues of $80 million and $89 million during the three months and $167 million and $169 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from Banco Bradesco.  Revenues from Banco  27Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)Bradesco included $10 million and $13 million of unfavorable currency impact during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and Brazilian Real.  A summary of the Company’s related party receivables and payables is as follows (in millions):    June 30, December 31,Related Party Balance Sheet Location 2018 2017      As AdjustedBanco Bradesco Trade receivables $40 $47Banco Bradesco Contract assets 8 5Banco Bradesco Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 9 10Banco Bradesco Other long-term liabilities 14 17(11) Net Earnings per ShareThe basic weighted average shares and common stock equivalents for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are computed using the treasury stock method.The following table summarizes the earnings per share attributable to FIS common stockholders for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 (in millions, except per share amounts): Three months endedJune 30, Six months endedJune 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017   As Adjusted   As AdjustedNet earnings attributable to FIS common stockholders$212 $139 $394 $269Weighted average shares outstanding — basic329 330 329 329Plus: Common stock equivalent shares4 4 5 5Weighted average shares outstanding — diluted333 334 334 334Net earnings per share — basic attributable to FIS common stockholders$0.64 $0.42 $1.20 $0.82Net earnings per share — diluted attributable to FIS common stockholders$0.64 $0.42 $1.18 $0.81Options to purchase 1 million and 4 million shares of our common stock for the three months and 1 million and 4 million shares for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.On July 20, 2017 our Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to $4.0 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2020.  This share repurchase authorization replaced any existing share repurchase authorization. (12) DivestituresOn July 31, 2017, FIS closed on the sale of a majority ownership stake in its Capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business to CD&R for cash proceeds of approximately $469 million, resulting in a pre-tax loss of approximately $41 million.  The divestiture is consistent with our strategy to focus on our IP-led businesses.  CD&R acquired preferred units convertible into 60% of the common units of Cardinal and FIS obtained common units representing the remaining 40%, in each case before equity is issued to management. The preferred units are entitled to a quarterly dividend at an annual rate of 12%, payable in cash (if available) or additional preferred units at FIS' option. The businesses sold were included within the GFS and IFS segments. The sale did not meet the standard necessary to be reported as discontinued  28Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)operations; therefore, the pre-tax loss and related prior period earnings remain reported within earnings.  Prior to the sale, the Capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business' pre-tax earnings, excluding certain unallocated corporate costs, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were $15 million and $18 million, respectively. FIS' 40% ownership in Cardinal was initially valued at $172 million and is recorded as an equity method investment included within other noncurrent assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (Unaudited). After the sale on July 31, 2017, FIS began to recognize after-tax equity method investment earnings (loss) outside of operating income and segment Adjusted EBITDA. For periods prior to July 31, 2017, the Capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business were included within operating income and segment Adjusted EBITDA.On February 1, 2017, the Company closed on the sale of the SunGard Public Sector and Education ("PS&E") business for $850 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $85 million.  The transaction included all PS&E solutions, which provided a comprehensive set of technology solutions to address public safety and public administration needs of government entities as well as the needs of K-12 school districts.  The divestiture is consistent with our strategy to serve the financial services markets.   Cash proceeds were used to reduce outstanding debt (see Note 7).  Net cash proceeds, after payment of taxes and transaction-related expenses, were approximately $500 million.  The PS&E business was included in the Corporate and Other segment.  The sale did not meet the standard necessary to be reported as discontinued operations; therefore, the gain and related prior period earnings remain reported within earnings.  Prior to the sale, PS&E's pre-tax earnings, excluding certain unallocated corporate costs, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were $0 million and $3 million, respectively.   (13) Segment Information Integrated Financial Solutions ("IFS")The IFS segment is focused primarily on serving North American clients for transaction and account processing, payment solutions, channel solutions, lending and wealth and retirement solutions, corporate liquidity, digital channels, risk and compliance solutions, and services, capitalizing on the continuing trend to outsource these solutions. Clients in this segment include regional and community banks, credit unions and commercial lenders, as well as government institutions, merchants and other commercial organizations.  IFS’ primary software applications function as the underlying infrastructure of a financial institution's processing environment.  These applications include core bank processing software, which banks use to maintain the primary records of their customer accounts, and complementary applications and services that interact directly with the core processing applications.  This market is primarily served through integrated solutions and characterized by multi-year processing contracts that generate highly recurring revenues.  The predictable nature of cash flows generated from this segment provides opportunities for further investments in innovation, integration, information and security, and compliance in a cost effective manner.  The business solutions in this segment included the risk and compliance consulting business through its divestiture on July 31, 2017 (Note 12).Global Financial Solutions ("GFS")The GFS segment is focused on serving the largest global financial institutions and/or international financial institutions with a broad array of capital markets and asset management and insurance solutions, as well as banking and payments solutions. GFS clients include the largest global financial institutions, including those headquartered in the United States, as well as all international financial institutions we serve as clients in more than 130 countries. These institutions face unique business and regulatory challenges and account for the majority of financial institution information technology spend globally. The purchasing patterns of GFS clients vary from those of IFS clients who typically purchase solutions on an outsourced basis. GFS clients purchase our solutions and services in various ways including licensing and managing technology “in-house”, fully outsourced end-to-end solutions, and using consulting and third-party service providers. We have long-established relationships with many of these financial institutions that generate significant recurring revenue.  GFS clients also include asset managers, buy- and sell-side securities and trading firms, insurers and private equity firms.  This segment also includes the Company's consolidated Brazilian Venture (Note 10).  The business solutions in this segment included the Capco consulting business through its divestiture on July 31, 2017 (Note 12). 29Table of ContentsFIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)Corporate and OtherThe Corporate and Other segment consists of corporate overhead expense, certain leveraged functions and miscellaneous expenses that are not included in the operating segments as well as certain non-strategic businesses.  The non-strategic businesses in this segment include the PS&E business through its divestiture on February 1, 2017 (Note 12), the global commercial services business and retail check processing business.  The overhead and leveraged costs relate to marketing, corporate finance and accounting, human resources, legal, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates revenue-generating segment performance, such as acquisition integration and severance costs.  The Corporate and Other segment also includes the impact on revenue for 2018 and 2017 of adjusting SunGard's deferred revenue to fair value. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 the Company recorded certain costs relating to integration and severance activity primarily from the SunGard acquisition of $49 million and $106 million, respectively.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 the Company recorded certain costs relating to integration and severance activity primarily from the SunGard acquisition of $39 million and $119 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDAThis measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, "Segment Reporting."  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income tax provision (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, including amortization of purchased intangibles), plus certain non-operating items.  The non-operating items affecting the segment profit measure generally include acquisition accounting adjustments, acquisition, integration and severance costs, and restructuring expenses.  For consolidated reporting purposes, these costs and adjustments are recorded in the Corporate and Other segment for the periods discussed below.  Adjusted EBITDA for the respective segments excludes the foregoing costs and adjustments. Summarized financial information for the Company’s segments is shown in the following tables.

Long-term assets, excluding goodwill and other intangible assets, located outside of the United States total $541 million and $515 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  These assets are predominantly located in the United Kingdom, India, Belgium, Germany,  France, Australia and Brazil.(14)    Share Repurchase ProgramOur Board of Directors has approved a series of plans authorizing repurchases of our common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions, the most current of which on July 20, 2017, authorized repurchases of up to $4.0 billion through December 31, 2020. This share repurchase authorization replaced any existing share repurchase authorization plan.  Approximately $3.3 billion of plan capacity remained available for repurchases as of June 30, 2018.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsUnless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, all references to “FIS,” “we,” the “Company” or the “registrant” are to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its subsidiaries.The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.  The statements contained in this Form 10-Q or in our other documents or in oral presentations or other statements made by our management that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.  Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about anticipated financial outcomes, including any earnings guidance of the Company, business and market conditions, outlook, foreign currency exchange rates, expected dividends and share repurchases, the Company’s sales pipeline and anticipated profitability and growth, as well as other statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future are forward-looking statements.  These statements relate to future events and our future results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management.  Any statements that refer to beliefs, expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

Through the depth and breadth of our solutions portfolio, global capabilities and domain expertise, FIS serves more than 20,000 clients in over 130 countries. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS employs more than 52,000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing, financial software and banking solutions.  Providing software, services and outsourcing of the technology that empowers the financial world, FIS is a Fortune 500 company and is a member of the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index. We have grown organically as well as through acquisitions, which have contributed critical applications and services that complement or enhance our existing offerings, diversifying our revenues by customer, geography and service offering.  The completion of the SunGard acquisition on November 30, 2015 increased our existing portfolio to include solutions that automate a wide range of complex business processes for financial services institutions and corporate and government treasury departments.FIS reports its financial performance based on three segments: Integrated Financial Solutions (“IFS”), Global Financial Solutions (“GFS”) and Corporate and Other.  A description of these segments is included in Note 13 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).  Revenues by segment and the adjusted EBITDA of our segments are discussed below in Segment Results of Operations. Business Trends and ConditionsOur revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services, professional services and software license fees.  The majority of our revenue has historically been recurring and has been provided under multi-year contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream.  These services, in general, are considered critical to our clients' operations.  A considerable portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of accounts and card transactions, among other variable measures, associated with consumer, commercial and capital markets activity.  Professional services revenues are typically non-recurring, and sales of software licenses are less predictable, a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients. The SunGard acquisition broadened our solution portfolio, enabling us to expand beyond our traditional banking and payments markets into the institutional and wholesale side of financial institutions as well as other capital markets organizations.  It also significantly expanded our existing solutions and client base in wealth and retirement, treasury and corporate payments.  These solutions are in demand among our regional and community financial institution clients as they look for ways to replace highly regulated fee revenues.  The combination also favorably impacted our revenue mix, with a greater concentration of license revenues and higher margin services.  Through the integration of SunGard into our existing operations, we achieved significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses and exited 2017 with a cost synergy run-rate savings exceeding $325 million.  We are actively migrating many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and on-going regulatory requirements.  As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate the effects of broader year-to-year economic and market changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations.  We believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are well-positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve.Consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions, and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch, mobile, internet and voice-banking channels.  We are focused on enabling our clients to deliver this experience to their customers through our integrated solutions and services.  We continue to innovate and invest in these integrated solutions and services to assist clients as they address this market demand.  This is an area of on-going competition from global banks, international providers and disruptive technology innovators. 34Table of ContentsWe continue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster, more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels, internet applications and cards.  We believe digital payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience, incremental services and benefits.  Additionally, new formidable non-traditional payments competitors and large merchants are investing in and innovating digital payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity, and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed.  We believe the growth of digital payments continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops.  Although we cannot predict which digital payment technologies or solutions will be successful, we cautiously believe our client relationships, payments infrastructure and experience, adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well-positioned to maintain or grow our clients' existing payment volumes, which is our focus. High profile North American merchant payment card information security breaches have pushed the payment card industry towards EMV integrated circuit cards as financial institutions, card networks and merchants seek to improve information security and reduce fraud costs.  We invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate EMV integrated circuit cards so we can continue to guide our clients through this technology transition and grow our card-driven businesses.  A large portion of the migration to EMV is complete.  The remaining portion will continue as financial institutions issue replacement cards.We anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue, primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity, which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business.  However, consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to our business.  When consolidations of financial institutions occur, merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers.  The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity.  Conversely, we may lose revenue if we are providing services to both entities, or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity.  It is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide.  We seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company. Notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions, our on-going international business continued to experience growth in the first half of 2018 on a constant currency basis.  Demand for our solutions may also continue to be driven in developing countries by government-led financial inclusion policies aiming to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions.  Although there may be quarterly fluctuations, for the full year of 2018 we anticipate minimal foreign currency impacts.Brazilian Venture revenue attributable to our Brazilian Venture partner, Banco Bradesco, was $167 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and $317 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.  The contract that we have with our Brazilian Venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract, which ends September 30, 2020, at any point during the 10-year term if minimum targets are met.  Minimum targets under the Brazilian Venture agreement have been met and the parties have begun negotiations to determine their future business relationship.  During these negotiations, the Brazilian Venture agreement remains in effect.  Depending on the results of these negotiations, our future revenue and earnings growth in Brazil could be adversely impacted.  For further detail on our Brazilian Venture see Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).Globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication.  This is a trend we expect to continue. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities.  The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public information.  These circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for FIS.  As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data.  We also operate payment, cash access and prepaid card systems. FIS remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems.  This includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services.  We also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients.  Through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement, we have developed fraud, security, risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry.    35Table of Contents  As described in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), on July 31, 2017, we sold a majority interest in certain of our consulting businesses to affiliates of CD&R.  These businesses had lower margins than many of our other businesses.  The consulting businesses sold were included within the GFS and IFS segments.  Also, on February 1, 2017, we sold our PS&E business, which had been included in our Corporate and Other segment.  These divestitures affect the comparability of our results of operations for the 2018 and 2017 periods presented.Critical Accounting PoliciesThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, except for "Revenue Recognition" noted below.Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates revenues in a number of ways, including from the delivery of account- or transaction-based processing, software as a service ("SaaS"), business process as a service ("BPaaS"), cloud offerings, software licensing, software related services, and professional services.  We are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client. These situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be combined or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition.  In making this determination, we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective, whether the solutions or services promised in the contracts are a single performance obligation, and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated.  Our individual contracts also frequently include multiple promised solutions or services.  At contract inception, we assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - i.e., if a solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.  We must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual promised solutions or services can be considered distinct or should instead be combined with other promised solutions or services in the contract.  We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to a customer.  We must use judgment to determine the appropriate measure of progress for performance obligations satisfied over time and the timing of when the customer obtains control for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time.  Judgment is also required in estimating and allocating variable consideration to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in a contract, determining the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation, and allocating the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a contract. Due to the large number, broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to, the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position.  However, the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar contracts or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position.  Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Notes 2 and 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).Transactions with Related PartiesSee Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for a detailed description of transactions with related parties.      36Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations (Unaudited)(in millions, except per share amounts) Three months endedJune 30, Six months endedJune 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017   As Adjusted *   As Adjusted *Revenues$2,106 $2,258 $4,172 $4,406Cost of revenues1,414 1,520 2,828 3,011Gross profit692 738 1,344 1,395Selling, general, and administrative expenses339 368 697 779Operating income353 370 647 616Other income (expense):       Interest expense, net(73) (91) (144) (183)Other income (expense), net(4) 4 (2) 60Total other income (expense), net(77) (87) (146) (123)Earnings before income taxes and equity method investment earnings (loss)276 283 501 493Provision (benefit) for income taxes51 136 85 210Equity method investment earnings (loss)(7) — (8) —Net earnings218 147 408 283Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest(6) (8) (14) (14)Net earnings attributable to FIS common stockholders$212 $139 $394 $269        Net earnings per share — basic attributable to FIS common stockholders$0.64 $0.42 $1.20 $0.82Weighted average shares outstanding — basic329 330 329 329Net earnings per share — diluted attributable to FIS common stockholders$0.64 $0.42 $1.18 $0.81Weighted average shares outstanding — diluted333 334 334 334* See Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).Comparisons of three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017RevenuesRevenues decreased $152 million, or 6.7%, during the three-month period, due to (1) the reduction in revenue from the sale of the Capco consulting business and the risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017; (2) a decline in the institutional and wholesale business driven by lower license fees; and (3) a decrease in license and one-time professional services revenue in our international banking solutions.  These decreases were partially offset by (1) increased volumes in banking and wealth solutions; (2) growth in corporate and digital solutions; (3) volume growth in the international payments group; and (4) higher termination fees.    Revenues decreased $234 million, or 5.3% during the six-month period, due to (1) the reduction in revenue from the sale of the PS&E business during the first quarter of 2017 and the sale of the Capco consulting business and the risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017; and (2) a decline in card production business. This decrease was partially offset by (1) increased volumes in banking and wealth solutions; (2) growth in corporate and digital solutions; and (3) volume growth in the international payments group.  Additionally, the six months ended June 30, 2018 also benefited from a $22 million favorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a weaker U.S. Dollar in 2018 versus the Euro and Pound Sterling.  See "Segment Results of Operations (Unaudited)" below for more detailed explanation.  37Table of ContentsCost of Revenues and Gross ProfitCost of revenues totaled $1,414 million and $1,520 million during the three-month periods and $2,828 million and $3,011 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, resulting in gross profit of $692 million and $738 million during the respective three-month periods and $1,344 million and $1,395 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 32.9%  and 32.7% during the three-month periods and 32.2%  and 31.7% during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The change in gross profit during the 2018 period as compared to 2017 primarily resulted from the revenue variances noted above.  The gross profit percentage change during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to 2017, is positively impacted by the Capco consulting business divestiture during 2017 as well as cost management initiatives.   Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled $339 million and $368 million during the three-month periods and $697 million and $779 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by the sale of PS&E during the first quarter of 2017, the sale of the Capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017 and cost management initiatives.Operating IncomeOperating income totaled $353 million and $370 million during the three-month periods and $647 million and $616 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Operating income as a percentage of revenue (“operating margin”) was 16.8% and 16.4% during the three-month periods and 15.5% and 14.0% during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The changes in operating income for the three-month and six-month periods of 2018 as compared to 2017 resulted from the variances addressed above.  The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from cost management initiatives and the Capco consulting business divestiture during 2017. Total Other Income (Expense), NetInterest expense is typically the primary component of total other income (expense); however, during the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, other income (expense) was also a significant component. The decrease of $18 million and $39 million in interest expense during the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the 2017 periods is primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate on the outstanding debt.Other income (expense) net decreased $8 million for the three-month periods and $62 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the 2017 periods.  The 2017 six-month period included a pre-tax gain of $85 million on the sale of the PS&E business and a pre-tax charge of approximately $25 million due to the redemption of the Senior Notes due March 2022 and the repayment of the 2018 Term Loans, consisting of the call premium on the Senior Notes due March 2022 and the write-off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs. Provision (Benefit) for Income TaxesIncome tax expense totaled $51 million and $136 million during the three-month periods and $85 million and $210 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, resulting in effective tax rates of 18% and 48% for the three-month periods and 17% and 43% for the the six-month periods, respectively.  The 2018 effective tax rate includes the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% due to tax reform enacted December 22, 2017.  In addition to the federal tax rate of 35% for 2017, the 2017 effective tax rates include the impact of the write-off of goodwill with no tax basis in connection with the sale of our PS&E business and additional taxes related to book basis in the stock of Capco Consulting Business assets held for sale in excess of tax basis. The Company included provisional amounts in its December 31, 2017 annual financial statements for certain tax reform items.  These items were provisional as the data necessary for their completion was not fully available.  As the amounts are finalized during the measurement period, the required adjustments, if any, will be recorded in the quarter when the final amount is determined. 38Table of ContentsEquity Method Investment Earnings (Loss) On July 31, 2017, FIS obtained a 40% equity interest in Cardinal as further described in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).  As a result, we recorded $7 million and $8 million in losses from this equity method investment during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively.Net Earnings Attributable to FIS Common StockholdersNet earnings attributable to FIS common stockholders totaled $212 million and $139 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.64 and $0.42 for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $394 million and $269 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.18 and $0.81 for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  These results reflect the variances described above.Segment Results of Operations (Unaudited)Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income tax provision (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, including amortization of purchased intangibles), plus certain non-operating items.  This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, "Segment Reporting."  The non-operating items affecting the segment profit measure generally include acquisition accounting adjustments, acquisition, integration and severance costs, and restructuring expenses.  For consolidated reporting purposes, these costs and adjustments are recorded in the Corporate and Other segment for the periods discussed below.  Adjusted EBITDA for the respective segments excludes the foregoing costs and adjustments.  Financial information, including details of our adjustments to EBITDA, for each of our segments is set forth in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) included in Part I of this Quarterly Report.Integrated Financial Solutions(in millions) Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017Revenues$1,124 $1,087 $2,185 $2,124Adjusted EBITDA$492 $466 $943 $905Three months ended June 30:Revenues increased $37 million, or 3.4%, due to the following: (1) increased volumes in banking and wealth solutions (excluding the effects of the sale of the risk and compliance consulting business) contributing 1.9%; (2) growth in corporate and digital solutions contributing 1.2%; (3) growth in retail payments contributing 0.4%; and (4) higher termination fees contributing 0.8%.

Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings, including the capacity under our Revolving Loan described in Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).  As of June 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $683 million and long-term debt of $8.9 billion, including the current portion, net of capitalized debt issuance costs. Of the $683 million cash and cash equivalents, approximately $428 million is held by our foreign entities.  The majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net deposits-in-transit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity.  We expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next 12 months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, capital expenditures and mandatory debt service.   We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends.  However, the amount, declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions.  Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements.  A regular quarterly dividend of $0.32 per common share was paid on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2018. On July 20, 2017 our Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to $4.0 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2020.  This share repurchase authorization replaced any existing share repurchase authorization. Cash Flows from OperationsCash flows from operations were $823 million and $528 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Our net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings, adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization.  Cash flows from operations were $295 million higher in the 2018 period primarily due to (1) higher net earnings during 2018 due to the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% due to tax reform enacted December 22, 2017 resulting in lower U.S. federal income tax payments and (2) lower trade receivables from increased collections resulting from a reduction in days sales outstanding.  These increases were partially offset by U.S. federal estimated income tax payments normally due in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 that were paid during the first quarter of 2018 due to the Hurricane Irma Relief Program and timing of working capital.Capital Expenditures and Other Investing ActivitiesOur principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment.  We invested approximately $316 million and $297 million in capital expenditures (excluding capital leases) during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. FinancingFor more information regarding the Company’s long-term debt and financing activity see Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).    41Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThere were no material changes in our contractual obligations during the first six months of 2018 in comparison to the table included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on February 22, 2018, except as disclosed in Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited). Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsFIS does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 (“ASU 2016-15”), “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.”  The amendments are meant to reduce the diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 provides guidance as to the presentation on the statement of cash flows for eight specific cash flow issues, which are 1) debt prepayment for debt extinguishment costs, 2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, 3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, 4) proceeds for the settlement of insurance claims, 5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, 6) distributions received from equity method investees, 7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and 8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  For public companies, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period.  FIS elected to adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2017.  FIS has applied the presentation guidance above to its statements of cash flows and all adjustments have been reflected on a retrospecive basis. The primary impact of adopting the new guidance is our 2017 presentation of debt prepayment and related costs being reflected in financing activities rather than operating activities.  This adoption impacted 2017 cash flows.In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12 (“ASU 2017-12”), “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.”  The amendments were meant to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements.  The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current GAAP.  ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; the ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update.  FIS elected to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2018.  The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07 (“ASU 2017-07”), “Compensation - Retirement Benefits.”  The ASU improves the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the statements of operations. Under ASU 2017-07, the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost is disclosed in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, and the other components are reported separately from the line item that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income.  ASU 2017-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  FIS adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-07 as of January 1, 2018.   There was no material impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) resulting from the adoption of this guidance.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 (“ASU 2016-18”), “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.”  ASU 2016-18 requires companies to include restricted amounts with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period total amounts shown on the Statements of Cash Flows.  FIS adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18 as of January 1, 2018.  FIS had no restricted cash during 2017 or 2018. As a result, there was no effect on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 (“ASU 2016-01”), “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”  ASU 2016-01 amends guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including significant revisions in accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.  The amendment requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net earnings  42Table of Contentsand amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.  In the period of adoption, the Company is required to reclassify the unrealized gains/losses on equity securities within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings.  In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-03, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10),” which clarified certain aspects of the previously issued ASU. FIS adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018.  As a result, there was no material effect on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).”  ASU 2014-09 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition, including industry-specific requirements, and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the International Financial Reporting Standards.  It also includes guidance on accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining and costs incurred to fulfill a contract with a customer.  The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards.  The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers.  The FASB has issued several amendments to Topic 606, including further guidance on principal versus agent consideration, clarification on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.The effective date of the standard was postponed to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption allowed for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2018.Entities can transition to the standard with retrospective application to the earliest years presented in their financial statements, retrospectively using certain practical expedients, or with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We adopted the new standard using the retrospective method with the application of certain practical expedients.The largest impacts from the adoption of Topic 606 on our revenue recognition are related to the following areas:•Certain revenues, particularly those related to interchange and third-party network fees associated with our payment processing business, previously recorded on a gross basis as a principal are now recorded on a net basis as an agent to the extent the Company does not control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer.  •Recognition of certain term license early renewals are now deferred until the conclusion of the term in effect at the time of renewal.  Previously, term license early renewals were generally recognized upon execution of the renewal agreement. •We now recognize the license portion of software rental fees in certain of our global trading, asset management, and securities processing businesses upon delivery.  Previously, software license rental fees were recognized ratably over the rental period as the payments became due and payable.Impacts related to other changes introduced by the standard were substantially less significant than those listed above.Upon retrospective application of Topic 606, our revenues decreased by approximately $455 million and $410 million and net earnings decreased approximately $58 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We recorded a net reduction to opening retained earnings of approximately $23 million as of January 1, 2016 due to the cumulative impact of adopting the standard.  The impact of Topic 606 on our 2017 and 2016 operating results may or may not be representative of the impact on subsequent years’ results.Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 (“ASU 2016-02”), “Leases (Topic 842).”  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of leases with a term of twelve months or less) at the commencement date: (a) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and (b) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.  Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged.  The pronouncement currently requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expire before the earliest comparative period presented.  A full retrospective transition approach is not permitted.  However, a new transition method has been approved by the FASB, though an official ASU has not been issued, that will permit the use of the effective date of the new standard as the date of initial application.  This proposed option will result in issuers not having to adjust comparative period financial statements for the effects of the new leases standard or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the effective date.  Public business entities  43Table of Contentsshould apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial position and results of operations.On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 (“ASU 2016-13”), “Financial Instrument - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements on Credit Losses of Financial Instruments.”  This ASU's primary objectives are to implement new methodology for calculating credit losses on financial instruments (e.g., trade receivables) based on expected credit losses and broadens the types of information companies must use when calculating the estimated losses.  Under current guidance, the credit losses are calculated based on multiple credit impairment objectives and recognition is delayed until the loss is probable to occur.  Under the new guidance, financial assets measured at amortized cost basis must be shown as the net amount expected to be collected.  The credit loss allowance is a contra-valuation account. Available-for-sale securities should continue to be recognized in a similar manner to current GAAP; however, the allowance should be presented as an allowance instead of a write-down of the basis of the asset.  For public companies that are SEC filers, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2018.  We do not plan to early adopt and expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statement presentation, financial position, or results of operations.Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market RisksMarket RiskWe are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  We periodically use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk.  We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity.Interest Rate RiskIn addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to finance our operations.  We are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps, if any.  The senior notes as described in Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) represent substantially all of our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations as of June 30, 2018.  The carrying value excluding unamortized discounts of the senior notes was $8,514 million as of June 30, 2018.  The fair value of the senior notes was approximately $8,387 million as of June 30, 2018.  The potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt.  Our floating rate long-term debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the FIS Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)).   An increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would increase our annual debt service under the FIS Credit Agreement by approximately $4 million (based on principal amounts outstanding as of June 30, 2018).  We performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of June 30, 2018.  This sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of June 30, 2018, and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt.  Further, in this sensitivity analysis, the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year.  For comparison purposes, based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of June 30, 2017, and calculated in the same manner as set forth above, an increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would have increased our annual interest expense, after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps, by approximately $8 million. As of June 30, 2018, we had no interest rate swaps.Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.  These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency.  We manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts and non-derivative investment hedges.  Contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.   44Table of ContentsOur exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our non-U.S. operations, to the extent they are conducted in local currency.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we generated approximately $378 million and $757 million, respectively, in revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.  The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Brazilian Real, the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Indian Rupee.  A 10% move in average exchange rates for these currencies (assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10% change in all of such rates for the relevant period) would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):  Three months endedJune 30, Six months endedJune 30,Currency 2018 2017 2018 2017Pound Sterling $9 $11 $17 $22Euro 7 10 15 19Real 9 10 19 19Indian Rupee 3 3 6 7Total increase or decrease $28 $34 $57 $67While our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations, our international operations' revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency, which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions.   Revenues included $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact during the three months and $22 million of favorable foreign currency impact during the six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, resulting from changes in the U.S. Dollar during 2018 as compared to 2017.  Net earnings attributable to FIS common stockholders included $3 million and $0 million of favorable foreign currency impact during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.  Although there may be quarterly fluctuations, for the full year of 2018 we anticipate minimal foreign currency impacts.Our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options, to reduce volatility in our results of operations and/or cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity.  We do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans.  We did not have significant forward contracts as of June 30, 2018.  The Company also utilizes non-derivative net investment hedges in order to reduce the volatility in the income statement caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates (see Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)).  Item 4. Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  However, in connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within those processes.  These included the development of new policies based on the new standard, new training, and gathering of information provided for disclosures. 45Table of ContentsPart II: OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1A.
