    TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.         NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     




1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Pronouncements  





Basis of Presentation  

        The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be
referred to as "we," "us," or "our") have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") and the instructions to
Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In management's opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments
necessary for a fair presentation of interim results. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire fiscal year or
any subsequent interim period. 
        The
year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements
should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017. 
        Unless
otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 are to our fiscal years ending September 28, 2018 and
ended September 29, 2017, respectively. 





Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement  

        In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09 which codified
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance supersedes ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition,
 and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to
revenue recognition. ASC 606, as amended, is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2019, and we intend to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective approach applied to
contracts that are not completed as of that date. We are continuing to assess the impact of adopting ASC 606. Based on the ongoing evaluation of our current contracts and revenue streams, we do not
expect that adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. We are in the process of identifying necessary changes to accounting policies, processes, financial
statement disclosures, internal controls, and systems to enable compliance with this new standard. We believe we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for the proper recognition, reporting,
and disclosure of revenue upon adoption of ASC 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019. 





Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement  

        In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, an update to ASC 715, Compensation—Retirement
Benefits, which changes the income statement presentation of net periodic pension benefit cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The ASU requires that service costs
be presented with other employee compensation costs within operating income and that other cost components be presented outside of operating income. We elected to early adopt this update in the
quarter ended December 29, 2017. The update was applied retrospectively and did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

2. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net (Continued) 





Fiscal 2018 Actions  

        During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting
the Industrial Solutions segment. In connection with this program, during the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $22 million. We expect to complete
significantly all restructuring actions commenced during the quarter ended December 29, 2017 by the end of fiscal 2019 and to incur total charges of approximately $30 million with the
remaining charges primarily in the Industrial Solutions segment. 





Fiscal 2017 Actions  

        During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural
improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during the quarters ended December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of
$5 million and $46 million, respectively. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2017 by the end of fiscal 2019 and to incur total charges of
approximately $160 million with the remaining charges primarily in the Communications Solutions segment. 





Pre-Fiscal 2017 Actions  

        Prior to fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures
in the Communications Solutions segment. During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we recorded net restructuring charges of $8 million related to pre-fiscal 2017 actions. We expect to
incur additional charges of approximately $15 million related to pre-fiscal 2017 actions with the remaining charges primarily in the Communications Solutions segment.

6. Debt  

        During October 2017, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, repaid, at maturity, $708 million 6.55% senior notes due 2017. 
        During
the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we reclassified $325 million of 2.375% senior notes due 2018 from long-term debt to short-term debt on the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
        During
December 2017, TEGSA entered into an uncommitted revolving credit facility under which it borrowed €100 million, at a 0% interest rate with repayment due at
maturity in December 2018. 
        As
of December 29, 2017, TEGSA had $241 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.96%. TEGSA had no commercial paper outstanding at
September 29, 2017. 
        The
fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,298 million and $4,622 million at December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017,
respectively. 




7. Commitments and Contingencies  





Legal Proceedings  

        In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product
liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value
added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable
law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 





Environmental Matters  

        We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate
cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given 
10



 
Table of Contents

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) 




7. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) 
the
uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of December 29, 2017, we concluded
that it was probable that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the range of $15 million to $44 million, and that the best estimate within this range was
$19 million. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 





Guarantees  

        In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown
damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing
facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
        At
December 29, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $291 million. 
        We
generally record estimated product warranty costs when contract revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method for construction related contracts; other warranty
reserves are not significant. The estimation is based primarily on historical experience and actual warranty claims. Amounts accrued for warranty claims were $49 million and $50 million
at December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017, respectively. 





Tax Sharing Agreement  

        As previously reported, under a Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International plc ("Tyco International"), and Covidien plc
("Covidien") share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the collective income tax returns for certain of our, Tyco
International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee
commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. We have substantially settled all U.S. federal income tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service for periods covered under the
Tax Sharing Agreement. Certain shared U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax matters remain open. We do not expect these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows.

8. Financial Instruments  

        We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany non-derivative financial instruments denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of
these hedges was $3,343 million and $3,110 million at December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017, respectively. The impacts of our hedging program were as follows:

        The
components of net periodic pension benefit cost other than service cost are included in other income (expense), net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        During
the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we contributed $13 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.

10. Income Taxes  

        We recorded income tax expense of $600 million and $54 million for the quarters ended December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, respectively. The income tax
expense for the quarter ended December 29, 2017 included $567 million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") and a $61 million
net income tax benefit related to certain legal entity restructurings. See "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" below for additional information. The income tax expense for the quarter ended December 30,
2016 included a $30 million income tax benefit associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany restructurings and the corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S. tax
loss carryforwards. 
        We
record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. As of December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017, we had
$62 million and $60 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income
taxes. During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we recognized $2 million of income tax expense related to interest and penalties on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
        Although
it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that up to approximately $40 million of unrecognized income tax benefits,
excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months. 
        We
are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as
of December 29, 2017. 





Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  

        On December 22, 2017, the President of the U.S. signed the Act into law. The Act includes numerous significant changes to existing tax
law, including a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, further limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation,
repeal of the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, and imposition of a territorial tax system with a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. While some of the
new provisions of the Act will impact us in fiscal 2019 and beyond, the change in the corporate income tax rate was effective January 1, 2018. During the quarter ended December 29, 2017,
we were required to revalue our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate in the period of enactment; accordingly, we recorded additional income tax
expense of $567 million primarily to write-down our net U.S. federal deferred tax asset to the lower statutory tax rate. Most of this charge related to the revaluation of our U.S. federal net
operating loss and interest carryforwards to the lower tax rate. Included in the $567 million charge was a $34 million benefit related to the reduction in the existing valuation
allowance recorded against certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards. The limitations on interest expense deductions contained in the Act are expected to increase prospective taxable income and
thereby allow the utilization of more tax credits in future years. As a Swiss corporation, the one-time repatriation tax imposed by the Act will not be significant to us. Also, we do not expect a
change in our fiscal 2018 cash taxes because of the new law. 
        The
Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, and in certain instances, lacks clarity and is subject to interpretation until additional Internal Revenue Service guidance
is issued. The 
13

10. Income Taxes (Continued) 
ultimate
impact of the Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions we made as well as any forthcoming regulatory guidance. One area requiring guidance is a
transition rule regarding limitations on interest expense deductions. The Act does not address the treatment of the carryforward of disallowed interest expense generated under the prior law. Our
interpretation is that the carryforward of interest should survive and is deductible in future periods subject to the new interest limitations. Accordingly, during the quarter ended
December 29, 2017, we revalued our beginning deferred tax asset related to our interest carryforwards to $223 million to reflect the lower statutory rate. It is possible additional
regulatory guidance could be issued contrary to this interpretation at which point we may be required to record a charge to income tax expense to revalue or eliminate the related deferred tax asset. 




11. Earnings (Loss) Per Share  

        The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share were as follows:

        There
were one million and two million share options that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the quarters ended December 29, 2017 and
December 30, 2016, respectively, because the instruments' underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of our common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive. 
        For
the quarter ended December 29, 2017, there were three million nonvested share awards and options outstanding with underlying exercise prices less than the average market
prices of our common shares; however, these were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as inclusion would be antidilutive as a result of our loss during the period. 




12. Shareholders' Equity  





Dividends  

        We paid a cash dividend of $0.40 per share during the quarter ended December 29, 2017. 
        Upon
shareholders' approval of a dividend payment, we record a liability with a corresponding charge to shareholders' equity. At December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017,
the unpaid portion of the dividends recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $140 million and $281 million, respectively.

    ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     
        The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that
reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to
those under the heading "Forward-Looking Information" and "Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors." 
        Our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). 
        The
following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure, together with GAAP financial measures,
provides useful information to investors because it is one of the financial measures that management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" for
more information about this non-GAAP financial measure, including our reasons for including the measure and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measure. 
 
 
  Overview     
        TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global technology and
manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. For more than 75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have
enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home. 
        Highlights
for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 include the following:


• Our net sales increased 13.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with sales growth in the
Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, partially offset by declines in the Communications Solutions segment. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by
$115 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2017. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 7.9% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as
compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
• Our net sales by segment were as follows:  


•Transportation Solutions—Our net sales increased 21.3% in the first
quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of sales increases in all end markets.   
•Industrial Solutions—Our net sales increased 10.9% during the first
quarter of fiscal 2018 due primarily to increased sales in the industrial equipment end market.   
•Communications Solutions—Our net sales decreased 4.6% in the first
quarter of fiscal 2018 with sales declines in the subsea communications end market, partially offset by sales increases in the appliances and, to a lesser degree, the data and devices end markets.  

• Net cash provided by operating activities was $350 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 





Outlook  
        In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect our net sales to be between $3.55 billion and $3.65 billion as compared to
$3.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This increase reflects sales growth in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, and to a lesser degree, the 
23



 
Table of Contents
Communications
Solutions segment relative to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as
compared to the same period of fiscal 2017 is as follows:


•Transportation Solutions—We expect our net sales increase in the automotive end
market to exceed anticipated global automotive production growth of approximately 2% due primarily to increased content per vehicle, market share gains, and sales contributions from a recent
acquisition. We also expect continued growth in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets. 
•Industrial Solutions—We expect our net sales to increase in the industrial
equipment end market due primarily to continued growth in the factory automation and controls market and the medical market.
•Communications Solutions—We expect our net sales growth in the appliances and the
data and devices end markets to be partially offset by sales declines in the subsea communications end market. 

We
expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.22 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This outlook reflects the positive impact of
foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $123 million and $0.06 per share, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the
second quarter of fiscal 2017. 
        For
fiscal 2018, we expect our net sales to be between $14.1 billion and $14.3 billion as compared to $13.1 billion in fiscal 2017. This increase reflects sales
growth in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments relative to fiscal 2017. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for fiscal 2018 compared to
fiscal 2017 is as follows:


•Transportation Solutions—We expect our net sales to increase in the automotive end
market due primarily to increased content per vehicle, market share gains, and sales contributions from a recent acquisition. We expect global automotive production to increase approximately 2% in
fiscal 2018. We also expect continued growth in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets. 
•Industrial Solutions—We expect our net sales to increase in the industrial
equipment end market primarily as a result of growth in the factory automation and controls market and the medical market.
•Communications Solutions—We expect our net sales growth in the appliances and the
data and devices end markets to be offset by sales declines in the subsea communications end market. We expect our sales in the subsea communications end market to be approximately $800 million
in fiscal 2018. 

We
expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.61 to $3.71 per share in fiscal 2018. This outlook reflects the positive impact of foreign currency exchange
rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $228 million and $0.11 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. 
        The
above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels. 
        We
are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We continue to closely manage our costs in line with
economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital

        Net
sales increased $417 million, or 13.6%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales resulted from organic
net sales growth of 7.9%, the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 3.7% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 2.0%. Price
erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $44 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 
        See
further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results." 
         Net Sales by Geographic Region.    Our business operates in three geographic regions—the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa
("EMEA"), and
Asia–Pacific—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to
other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. 
        Approximately
60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

        Gross
margin increased $110 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to higher
volume and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by the negative impact of price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.8% in the first quarter of 2018 from
34.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
        Cost
of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. We
expect to purchase approximately 200 million pounds of copper, 140,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.7 million troy

         Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.    Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $16 million in the
first quarter of
fiscal 2018 from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels. Selling, general, and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.0% in the first quarter of 2018 from 12.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
        Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses.    In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, research, development, and engineering
expenses increased
$20 million as compared to the same period of fiscal 2017 due to costs related to growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment. 
         Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.    We are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate
opportunities to simplify
our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness
in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth. 
        During
fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions segment. During
fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments. 
        In
connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $35 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, of which $22 million related to the
fiscal 2018 restructuring program. Annualized cost savings related to fiscal 2018 actions commenced during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $20 million and are
expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2019. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2018, we expect to incur
net restructuring charges of approximately $150 million. We 
27



 
Table of Contents
expect
total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2018.

        Net
sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $357 million, or 21.3%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to organic net
sales growth of 13.4%, the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 4.7%, and sales contributions from an acquisition of 3.2%. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as
follows:


•Automotive—Our organic net sales increased 10.2% in the first quarter of fiscal
2018 with growth of 14.5% in the Americas region, 13.3% in the EMEA region, and 6.2% in the Asia–Pacific region. In the Americas region, our organic net sales increased due to content
growth in North America and continued market recovery in South America. Our growth in the EMEA region was driven by market growth, electronification, and new model launches. Our growth in the
Asia–Pacific region resulted from market share gains and electronification. 
•Commercial transportation—Our organic net sales increased 34.2% in the first
quarter of fiscal 2018, with growth in the heavy truck, construction, and agriculture markets and sales increases across all regions. 
•Sensors—Our organic net sales increased 10.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018
due primarily to growth in the commercial transportation, industrial equipment, and automotive markets.

        In
the first quarter of fiscal 2018, net sales in the Industrial Solutions segment increased $87 million, or 10.9%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of
organic net sales growth of 6.3% and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 3.6%. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as
follows:


•Industrial equipment—Our organic net sales increased 16.9% in the first quarter of
fiscal 2018 due primarily to growth in the factory automation and controls market and the medical market. 
•Aerospace, defense, oil, and gas—Our organic net sales decreased 2.2% in the first
quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of declines in our sales into the commercial aerospace market. 
•Energy—Our organic net sales decreased 6.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due
to weakness in the power market and declines in all regions.

        Net
sales in the Communications Solutions segment decreased $27 million, or 4.6%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due
primarily to organic net sales declines of 5.7%. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:


•Data and devices—Our organic net sales increased 1.9% in the first quarter of
fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of market strength in the Asia–Pacific region and continued growth in high speed connectivity in data center applications.  
•Subsea communications—Our organic net sales decreased 33.2% in the first quarter of
fiscal 2018 as a result of lower levels of project activity and production delays on a program. 
•Appliances—Our organic net sales increased 21.7% in the first quarter of fiscal
2018 due to market share gains and growth in all regions.

Excluding

  Liquidity and Capital Resources     
        Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by
our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations
and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $325 million
of 2.375% senior notes due in 2018. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product
lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law. The cost or availability of
future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. 




Cash Flows from Operating Activities  
        In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $54 million to $350 million from
$404 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in employee-compensation related payments, partially offset by higher pre-tax income levels. 
        The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $82 million and $96 million, respectively. 




Cash Flows from Investing Activities  
        Capital expenditures were $241 million and $130 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect
fiscal 2018 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing
infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization  
        Total debt at December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017 was $4,005 million and $4,344 million, respectively. See
Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. 
        During
October 2017, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, repaid, at maturity, $708 million 6.55% senior notes due 2017. 
        During
December 2017, TEGSA entered into an uncommitted revolving credit facility under which it borrowed €100 million, at a 0% interest rate with repayment due at
maturity in December 2018. 
        TEGSA
has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with a maturity date of December 2020 and total commitments of $1,500 million. TEGSA had no
borrowings under the
Credit Facility at December 29, 2017 or September 29, 2017. Borrowings under our commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility and reduce the availability of funds from the
Credit Facility. 
        The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is
triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of December 29,
2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. 
        In
addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit
Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. 
        Payments
of common share dividends to shareholders were $141 million and $132 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
        During
the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in the share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately
2 million of our common shares for $214 million and approximately 2 million of our common shares for $102 million under our share repurchase program during the first
quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 29, 2017, we had $1,766 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
 
 
  Commitments and Contingencies     




Legal Proceedings  
        In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product
liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters,
including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our
experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows. 




Guarantees  
        In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with 
34



 
Table of Contents
end
dates ranging from fiscal 2018 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under
the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
        In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
        At
December 29, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $291 million. 




Tax Sharing Agreement  
        As previously reported, we are a party to a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Tyco International plc's, and
Covidien plc's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations with respect to taxes for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. See Note 7 to the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. 
 
 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     
        The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. 
        Our
accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension liabilities are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions
made by management. For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements
and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017. There were no significant changes to this information during the first
quarter of fiscal 2018. 
 
 
  Accounting Pronouncements     
        See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting
pronouncements. 
 
 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measure     




Organic Net Sales Growth  
        We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to
results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and
acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely
under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture
activity. 
35



 
Table of Contents
        Organic
net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also,
management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also
a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The
tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
        Organic
net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be
comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or
decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact
of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. 
 
 
  Forward-Looking Information     
        Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements
include, among others, the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities,
potential operating performance improvements, acquisitions, divestitures, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "believe," "expect," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict,"
"potential," "continue," "may," "should," or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. 
        Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Investors should
not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We do not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements after we file this report except as required by law. 
        The
following and other risks, which are described in greater detail in "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 29, 2017, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements:


• conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets, and cyclical industry conditions;  
• conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve, particularly the automotive industry;  
• competition and pricing pressure; 
• market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles; 
• raw material availability, quality, and cost; 
• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 
• financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors; 

36



 
Table of Contents


• reliance on third-party suppliers; 
• risks associated with current and future acquisitions and divestitures; 
• global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political, economic, and military instability;  
• risks associated with security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure;  
• risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations; 
• our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; 
• risks of litigation; 
• our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments; 
• the possible effects on us of various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives that, if adopted, could materially increase
our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our U.S. government contracts business; 
• the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; 
• various risks associated with being a Swiss corporation; 
• the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares; and 
• the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals. 

        There
may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
    ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     
        There have been no significant changes in our exposures to market risk during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. For further discussion of our
exposures to market risk, refer to "Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 29, 2017.  
 
    ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     




Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
        Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of December 29, 2017. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 29, 2017. 




Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
        During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
