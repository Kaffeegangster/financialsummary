Consolidated Financial Statements.7MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATIONThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Maxim Integrated”) included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature which were considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data were derived from audited consolidated financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the three months ended September 29, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Company has a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in June. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will be a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal year 2018 was a 53-week fiscal year and fiscal year 2019 is a 52-week fiscal year.NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements(i) New Accounting Updates Recently AdoptedIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This standard provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires reporting companies to disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 and related amendments (ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date; ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU  2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application (i.e., July 1, 2018). Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605. There was no impact on the opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606. However, in conjunction with the adoption of the new standard, the Company recorded a reclassification of accrued revenue reserves for price adjustments and other revenue reserves from accounts receivable, net to price adjustment and other revenue reserves within current liabilities. The cumulative effect of the changes to the condensed consolidated balance sheet from the adoption of Topic 606 was as follows (in thousands): As of June 30, 2018 Effect of Adoption of Topic 606 As of July 1, 2018      Accounts receivable, net$280,072 $141,652 $421,724Price adjustment and other revenue reserves— 141,652 141,652Balance Sheet ReclassificationUnder Topic 605, the gross amount of accrued revenue reserves for price adjustments and other revenue reserves of $141.7 million was included within accounts receivable, net as of June 30, 2018. Subsequent to the adoption of Topic 606, such 8balances are presented on a gross basis as accrued price adjustments and other revenue reserves of $141.7 million, which is presented in the price adjustment and other revenue reserves balance sheet caption.The adoption of Topic 606 has no impact on the total cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.The following table summarizes the impacts of adopting Topic 606 on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 29, 2018 (in thousands): As Reported If Reported Under Topic 605 Effect of Adoption of Topic 606      Accounts receivable, net$439,407 $304,220 $135,187Price adjustment and other revenue reserves135,187 — 135,187Practical Expedients and Elections•The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.•The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs after the customer obtains control of the goods.•The Company has elected to exclude sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes, if applicable, from the measurement of the transaction price. The transaction price excludes sales and other similar taxes.Updated Revenue Recognition PolicyThe Company recognizes revenue for sales to direct customers and sales to distributors when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The transaction price is calculated as selling price net of variable considerations, such as distributor price adjustments. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration that is expected to be entitled. The transaction price does not include amounts collected on behalf of another party, such as sales taxes or value added tax. The Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. The Company estimates returns for sales to direct customers and distributors based on historical return rates applied against current period gross revenue. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate. Accounts receivable from direct customers and distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment, at which point the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms. Accounts receivable related to consigned inventory is recognized when the customer takes title to such inventory from its consigned location, at which point inventory is relieved, title transfers, and the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under the terms of the agreement with the related customers. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company's standard terms, which is net 30 days from the date of invoice. The Company does not have any significant financing components greater than one year.  The Company estimates potential future returns and sales allowances related to current period product revenue. Management analyzes historical returns, changes in customer demand and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of returns and sales allowances. Estimates made may differ from actual returns and sales allowances. These differences may materially impact reported revenue and amounts ultimately collected on accounts receivable. Historically, such differences have not been material.Distributor price adjustments are estimated based on our historical experience rates and also considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the estimates we have made based on our historical rates.9The Company's revenue arrangements do not contain significant financing components. Revenue is recognized over a period of time when it is assessed that performance obligations are satisfied over a period rather than at a point in time. When any of the following criteria is fulfilled, revenue is recognized over a period of time:(a) The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the performance completed.(b) Performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced.(c) Performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, and has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, with further classifications made recently with the issuance of ASU 2018-03 and ASU 2018-04, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The application of this ASU was made by the means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet for the equity securities that qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value using the net asset value per share. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) is being applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. As a result of this adoption, the Company recognized an increase of $2.5 million, net of tax, in retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year 2019.In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. ASU 2016-16 requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs instead of when the asset is sold. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which requires employers that offer or maintain defined benefit plans to disaggregate the service component from the other components of net benefit cost and provides guidance on presentation of the service component and the other components of net benefit cost in the statement of operations. The application of ASU 2017-07 requires retrospective basis for all periods presented. The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.   In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in this standard provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. Unless the changes in terms or conditions meet all three criteria outlined in the guidance, modification accounting should be applied. The three criteria relate to changes in the terms and conditions that affect the fair value, vesting conditions, or classification of a share-based payment award. The guidance is required to be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. The Company adopted ASU 2017-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This standard provides guidance about the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. There was no material change to the Company's consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU largely aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees. Under the new guidance, both sets of awards, for employees and non-employees, will essentially follow the same model, with small discrepancies related to the term assumption when valuing non-employee awards. The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.(ii) Recent Accounting Updates Not Yet EffectiveIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the lease accounting requirements in Topic 840. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of use asset and a 10corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The guidance also requires qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity's leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. This guidance is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 on a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which improves disclosures by removing, modifying and adding disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The update highlights adjustments in disclosures for changes in the fair value of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 instruments. This guidance is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe that this update will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

This hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Interest on the 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2017. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $495.2 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses.On November 21, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.5% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in November 2018 (“2018 Notes”), with an effective interest rate of 2.6%. Interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2014. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $494.5 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses.On March 18, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.375% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in March 2023 (“2023 Notes”), with an effective interest rate of 3.5%. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2013. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $490 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses.The debt indentures that govern the 2027 Notes, the 2023 Notes and the 2018 Notes, respectively, include covenants that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, which could limit the Company's ability to secure additional debt funding in the future. In circumstances involving a change of control of the Company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the 2027 Notes, the 2023 Notes or the 2018 Notes, the Company would be required to make an offer to repurchase the affected notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 15The Company accounts for all the notes above based on their amortized cost. The discount and expenses are being amortized to Interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the notes. The interest expense is recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amortized discount and expenses, as well as interest expense associated with the notes, were $12.4 million and $12.6 million during the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively. The estimated fair value of the Company's outstanding debt obligations was approximately $1,461 million as of September 29, 2018. The estimated fair value of the debt is based primarily on observable market inputs and is a Level 2 measurement.The Company recorded interest expense of $12.6 million and $12.6 million during the three months ended September 29, 2018, and September 23, 2017, respectively. Credit FacilityRevolving credit facilityThe Company has access to a $350 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on June 27, 2019. The facility fee is at a rate per annum that varies based on the Company's index debt rating and any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the Company's index debt rating. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of not more than 3 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) greater than 3.5 to 1. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility and was in compliance with all debt covenants.Other Financial InstrumentsFor the balance of the Company's financial instruments, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. NOTE 6: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONAt September 29, 2018, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Company's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1996 Plan”) and one employee stock purchase plan, the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2008 ESPP”). The 1996 Plan was adopted by the board of directors to provide the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and market stock units (“MSUs”) to employees, directors, and consultants. Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over a four-year period measured from the date of grant. Options generally expire no later than seven years after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon an optionee's cessation of employment or service. RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. RSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements. MSUs granted to employees typically vest over a four-year cliff period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. The number of shares that are released at the end of the performance period can range from zero to a maximum cap depending on the Company's performance. For MSUs granted prior to September 2017, the performance metrics of this program are based on relative performance of the Company's stock price as compared to the Semiconductor Exchange Traded Fund index SPDR S&P (the “XSD”). For MSUs granted September 2017 and after, the performance metrics for this program are based on the total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company relative to the TSR of the other companies included in the XSD; these MSUs vest based upon annual performance subject to continued service through the end of the four-year cliff period. MSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements.16The following tables show total stock-based compensation expense by type of award, and the resulting tax effect, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively: Three Months EndedSeptember 29, 2018September 23, 2017Stock OptionsRestricted Stock UnitsEmployee Stock Purchase PlanTotalStock OptionsRestricted Stock UnitsEmployee Stock Purchase PlanTotal(in thousands)Cost of goods sold$10$1,761$507$2,278$86$1,836$478$2,400Research and development118,6921,1559,8583086,5889707,866Selling, general and administrative567,6456618,3623636,1305287,021Pre-tax stock-based compensation expense$77$18,098$2,323$20,498$757$14,554$1,976$17,287Less: income tax effect1,9642,890Net stock-based compensation expense$18,534$14,397The expenses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for RSUs include expenses related to MSUs of $2.4 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively.Stock OptionsThe fair value of options granted to employees under the 1996 Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. There were no stock options granted in the three months ended September 29, 2018 or September 23, 2017. The following table summarizes outstanding, exercisable and vested and expected to vest stock options as of September 29, 2018 and their activity for the three months ended September 29, 2018: Number ofShares  Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1)Balance at June 30, 20181,688,253 $27.72    Options Granted— —    Options Exercised(331,332) 26.66    Options Cancelled(3,439) 28.08    Balance at September 29, 20181,353,482 $27.98 1.7 $42,687,390Exercisable, September 29, 20181,353,482 $27.98 1.7 $42,687,390Vested and expected to vest, September 29, 20181,353,482 $27.98 1.7 $42,687,390(1)Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on September 28, 2018, the last business day preceding the fiscal quarter-end, multiplied by the number of options outstanding, exercisable or vested and expected to vest as of September 29, 2018.As of September 29, 2018, there was no unrecognized stock compensation from unvested stock options.Restricted Stock Units and Other Awards17The fair value of RSUs and other awards under the Company's 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company's common stock prior to vesting. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis. The weighted-average fair value of RSUs and other awards granted was $54.98 and $41.69 per share for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively. The following table summarizes the outstanding and expected to vest RSUs and other awards as of September 29, 2018 and their activity during the three months ended September 29, 2018: Number ofShares  Weighted AverageRemainingContractual Term(in Years)  Aggregate IntrinsicValue (1) Balance at June 30, 20185,524,432    Restricted stock units and other awards granted1,232,654    Restricted stock units and other awards released(407,431)    Restricted stock units and other awards cancelled(127,997)    Balance at September 29, 20186,221,658 3.0 $370,516,643Outstanding and expected to vest, September 29, 20185,121,814 2.9 $304,850,402 (1)Aggregate intrinsic value for RSUs and other awards represents the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on September 28, 2018, the last business day preceding the fiscal quarter-end, multiplied by the number of RSUs outstanding or expected to vest as of September 29, 2018. The Company withheld shares totaling $7.5 million in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date for the three months ended September 29, 2018. The total payments for the employees' tax obligations to the taxing authorities are reflected as financing activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.As of September 29, 2018, there was $187.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 6.2 million unvested RSUs and other awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years. Market Stock Units (MSUs)The Company grants MSUs to senior members of management in lieu of granting stock options. For MSUs granted prior to September 2017, the performance metrics of this program are based on relative performance of the Company's stock price as compared to the Semiconductor Exchange Traded Fund index SPDR S&P (the “XSD”). For MSUs granted in September 2017 and after, the performance metrics for this program are based on the total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company relative to the TSR of the other companies included in the XSD. The fair value of MSUs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis. Compensation expense is recognized based on the initial valuation and is not subsequently adjusted as a result of the Company's performance relative to that of the XSD or the TSR of the companies included in the XSD, as applicable. Vesting for MSUs is contingent upon both service and market conditions and has a four-year vesting cliff period. MSUs granted in September 2017 vest based upon annual performance and are subject to continued service through the end of the four-year period, but will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements.The weighted-average fair value of MSUs granted was $75.48 and $51.03 per share for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively. 18The following table summarizes the number of MSUs outstanding and expected to vest as of September 29, 2018 and their activity during the three months ended September 29, 2018: Number ofShares  Weighted AverageRemainingContractual Term(in Years)  Aggregate IntrinsicValue (1) Balance at June 30, 20181,079,064    Market stock units granted247,804    Market stock units released(13,594)    Market stock units cancelled(245,082)    Balance at September 29, 20181,068,192 3.1 $63,578,788Outstanding and expected to vest, September 29, 2018925,295 3.0 $55,073,544 (1)Aggregate intrinsic value for MSUs represents the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on September 28, 2018, the last business day preceding the fiscal quarter-end, multiplied by the number of MSUs outstanding or expected to vest as of September 29, 2018. As of September 29, 2018, there was $38.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 1.1 million unvested MSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.1 years. Employee Stock Purchase PlanEmployees are granted rights to acquire common stock under the 2008 ESPP.The fair value of 2008 ESPP rights granted to employees has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model using the following assumptions for the offering periods outstanding: Three Months Ended September 29, 2018 September 23, 2017Expected holding period (in years)0.5 years 0.5 yearsRisk-free interest rate1.6% - 2.1% 0.8% - 1.1%Expected stock price volatility19.6% - 32.7% 19.1% - 24.7%Dividend yield2.8% -3.1% 3.0% - 3.4%As of September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, there was $3.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of unrecognized compensation expense related to the 2008 ESPP.NOTE 7: EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHAREBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For purposes of computing basic earnings (loss) per share, the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock excludes unvested RSUs and other awards as well as MSUs. Diluted earnings (loss) per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, assumed release of unvested RSUs and other awards as well as MSUs, and assumed issuance of common stock under the 2008 ESPP using the treasury stock method.19The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share: Three Months Ended September 29, 2018 September 23, 2017 (in thousands, except per share data)Numerator for basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share   Net income (loss)$197,423 $154,533    Denominator for basic earnings (loss) per share278,045 282,170Effect of dilutive securities:   Stock options, ESPP, RSUs, and MSUs4,409 4,267Denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share282,454 286,437    Earnings (loss) per share   Basic$0.71 $0.55Diluted$0.70 $0.54For the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, no stock awards were determined to be anti-dilutive and therefore none were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.NOTE 8: SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed signal integrated circuits.

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 allows the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if accounting for the income tax effects of the Act has not been completed. Provisional amounts must be adjusted within one year from the enactment date of the Act.  In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a $236.9 million discrete provisional Transition Tax charge. No adjustment to the provisional Transition Tax charge was made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as the Company continues to gather information and analyze available guidance to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax.The Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a  fiscal year 2018 federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the Company (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018). The Company's federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%.The Act contains Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, which first impact the Company in fiscal year 2019. The GILTI provisions effectively subject income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries to current U.S. tax at a rate of 10.5%, less foreign tax credits. Under U.S. GAAP the Company can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to impact GILTI in future years or provide for tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense. The Company has elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense.  The Company's federal statutory tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 is 21%. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2018 of 15.5% was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by tax expense related to GILTI.The Company's federal statutory tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 35%. The Act did not impact the  federal statutory tax rate and income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 because it was enacted after the end of that quarter. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 23, 2017 of 14.6% was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and a $2.0 million discrete benefit for excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by share-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected and $3.9 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.The Company engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, could decrease up to $439.0 million within the next twelve months due to the completion of federal tax audits, including any administrative appeals. The $439.0 million primarily relates to matters involving federal taxation of cross-border transactions.The Company's federal corporate income tax returns are audited on a recurring basis by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The IRS concluded its field examination of the Company's federal corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and issued an IRS Revenue Agent's Report in July 2016 that included proposed adjustments for transfer pricing issues related to cost sharing and buy-in license payments for the use of intangible property by one of the Company's international subsidiaries. The Company disagreed with the proposed transfer pricing adjustments and related penalties, and in September 2016, the Company filed a protest to challenge the proposed adjustments and request a conference with the Appeals Office of the IRS. In May 2018, a preliminary understanding was reached with the IRS regarding the contested issues for the audit and post-audit years, which the Company expects may be finalized in fiscal year 2019 with the execution of a closing agreement. In June 2018, the Company made advance payments for audit and post-audit year tax of $140.7 million and interest of $37.4 million. These payments will reduce the accrual of interest on audit and post-audit year tax deficiencies that would be owed if the preliminary understanding is finalized. The Company's reserves for unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the audit and post-audit year tax deficiencies that would be owed as a result of the preliminary understanding. In fiscal year 2017, the IRS commenced an audit of the Company's federal corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2012 through 2014, which is ongoing. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Company was notified that the IRS will commence an audit of the Company's federal corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2015 through 2016.NOTE 11: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLegal Proceedings22 The Company is party or subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to intellectual property matters. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized or reserved, if any. IndemnificationThe Company indemnifies certain customers, distributors, suppliers and subcontractors for attorney fees, damages and costs awarded against such parties in certain circumstances in which the Company's products are alleged to infringe third party intellectual property rights, including patents, registered trademarks or copyrights. The terms of the Company's indemnification obligations are generally perpetual from the effective date of the agreement. In certain cases, there are limits on and exceptions to the Company's potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims.Pursuant to the Company's charter documents and separate written indemnification agreements, the Company has certain indemnification obligations to its current officers, employees and directors, as well as certain former officers and directors.NOTE 12: COMMON STOCK REPURCHASESOn July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. All prior repurchase authorizations by the Company's board of directors for the repurchase of common stock were cancelled and superseded by this repurchase authorization.During the three months ended September 29, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock for $112.5 million. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization of $505.9 million for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company's common stock and general market and business conditions.On October 30, 2018, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. The Company's prior repurchase authorization has been cancelled and superseded by this new repurchase authorization.NOTE 13: ACQUISITIONOn January 26, 2018, the Company acquired a privately-held corporation specializing in the development of high performance USB and video extension technology. Total cash consideration paid in connection with this acquisition was $57.8 million, net of cash acquired. The Company also agreed to pay up to an additional $16.0 million if the acquired business achieves certain financial milestones for the annual periods ended August 31, 2018 and August 31, 2019, of which $8.0 million was paid during the three months ended September 29, 2018. The acquired assets included $26.0 million of developed technology and $10.5 million of other intangible assets. The Company also recorded $41.9 million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.NOTE 14: GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSGoodwillThe Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no changes to goodwill for the three months ended September 29, 2018.No indicators or instances of impairment were identified in the three months ended September 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.Intangible assets consisted of the following: 23 September 29, 2018 June 30, 2018 Original Cost  Accumulated Amortization  Net Original Cost  Accumulated Amortization  Net (in thousands)Intellectual property$488,846 $430,784 $58,062 $485,465 $423,869 $61,596Customer relationships116,505 103,885 12,620 116,294 103,217 13,077Trade name9,974 8,661 1,313 9,340 8,588 752Patents2,500 2,500 — 2,500 2,469 31Total amortizable purchased intangible assets617,825 545,830 71,995 613,599 538,143 75,456IPR&D2,790 — 2,790 2,790 — 2,790Total purchased intangible assets$620,615 $545,830 $74,785 $616,389 $538,143 $78,246The following table presents the amortization expense of intangible assets and its presentation in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income: Three Months Ended September 29, 2018 September 23, 2017 (in thousands)Cost of goods sold$6,915 $11,064Intangible asset amortization773 1,752Total intangible asset amortization expenses$7,688 $12,816The following table represents the estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets as of September 29, 2018: Fiscal Year Amount  (in thousands)Remaining nine months of 2019 $17,2672020 15,3682021 13,6692022 7,9892023 7,505Thereafter 10,197Total intangible assets $71,995NOTE 15: RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIESFiscal year 2019:During the three months ended September 29, 2018, the Company recorded $1.0 million in "Severance and restructuring expenses" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income related to various restructuring plans designed to reduce costs.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSMaxim Integrated Products, Inc. (“Maxim Integrated” or the “Company” and also referred to as “we,” “our” or “us”) disclaims any duty to and undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information relating to existing conditions, future events or otherwise or to release publicly the results of any future revisions it may make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers should carefully review future reports and documents that the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC from time to time, such as its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and any Current Reports on Form 8-K.Overview of BusinessMaxim Integrated is incorporated in the state of Delaware. Maxim Integrated designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of geographically diverse customers. We also provide a range of high-frequency process technologies and capabilities that can be used in custom designs. The analog market is fragmented and characterized by many diverse applications, a great number of product variations and, with respect to many circuit types, relatively long product life cycles. We are a global company with a wafer manufacturing facility in the U.S., testing facilities in the Philippines and Thailand, and sales and circuit design offices around the world. We also utilize third party foundries for manufacturing of our products. The major end-markets in which our products are sold are the Automotive, Communications and Data Center, Computing, Consumer and Industrial markets.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require us to make our most difficult and subjective accounting judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenues; valuation of inventories, which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, which impacts impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the income tax provision; and assessment of litigation and contingencies, which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and income taxes. These policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We have other significant accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates 25and judgments that are as difficult or subjective, or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period. Except for the accounting policies and estimates outlined under Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 2, there have been no material changes during the three months ended September 29, 2018 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 26RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following table sets forth certain Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income data expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:  Three Months Ended September 29, 2018 September 23, 2017    Net revenues100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold32.6 % 35.1 %Gross margin67.4 % 64.9 %Operating expenses:   Research and development17.7 % 18.9 %Selling, general and administrative12.8 % 12.8 %Intangible asset amortization0.1 % 0.3 %Impairment of long-lived assets— % — %Severance and restructuring expenses0.2 % 0.9 %Other operating expenses (income), net— % (0.1)%Total operating expenses30.7 % 32.8 %Operating income (loss)36.7 % 32.2 %Interest and other income (expense), net(0.1)% (0.7)%Income before provision for income taxes36.6 % 31.4 %Income tax provision (benefit)5.7 % 4.6 %Net income (loss)30.9 % 26.8 %The following table shows stock-based compensation included in the components of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income reported above as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended September 29, 2018 September 23, 2017Cost of goods sold0.5% 0.4%Research and development1.4% 1.4%Selling, general and administrative1.2% 1.2% 3.1% 3.0%Net RevenuesNet revenues were $638.5 million and $575.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively. Revenue from consumer products was up 13%, primarily driven by higher sales of wearables, smartphones and other consumer products. Revenue from automotive products was up 15%, primarily driven by growth in battery management systems for electric vehicles and auto safety and security products. Revenue from industrial products was also up 12%, primarily driven by higher sales of control and automation products. During the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, approximately 89% and 89% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States. While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017 was immaterial.27Gross Margin Our gross margin percentages were 67.4% and 64.9% for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively. Our gross margin increased by 2.5 percentage points, due to improved factory utilization and a reduction in intangible amortization.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses were $112.7 million and $108.6 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively, which represented 17.7% and 18.9% of net revenues for each respective period. The $4.1 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses.Selling, General and AdministrativeSelling, general and administrative expenses were $81.5 million and $73.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively, which represented 12.8% and 12.8% of net revenues for each respective period. The $7.8 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses.Severance and Restructuring ExpensesSeverance and restructuring expenses were $1.0 million and $5.4 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively, which represented 0.2% and 0.9% of net revenues for each respective period. The $4.4 million decrease was primarily due to the timing of reorganization of certain business units and functions.Provision for Income Taxes In the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $36.2 million and $26.4 million, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017 was 15.5% and 14.6%, respectively.On December 22, 2017 legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), was enacted. The Act included a one-time tax on accumulated unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”).  SEC Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 allows the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if accounting for the income tax effects of the Act has not been completed. Provisional amounts must be adjusted within one year from the enactment date of the Act. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a $236.9 million discrete provisional Transition Tax charge. No adjustment to the provisional Transition Tax charge was made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as the Company continues to gather information and analyze available guidance to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax.The Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a fiscal year 2018 federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the Company (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018). The Company's federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%.The Act contains Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, which first impact the Company in fiscal year 2019. The GILTI provisions effectively subject income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries to current U.S. tax at a rate of 10.5%, less foreign tax credits. Under U.S. GAAP the Company can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to impact GILTI in future years or provide for tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense. The Company has elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense.  The Company's federal statutory tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 is 21%. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2018 of 15.5% was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by tax expense related to GILTI.The Company's federal statutory tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 35%. The Act did not impact the federal statutory tax rate and income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 because it was enacted after the end of that quarter. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 23, 2017 of 14.6% was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and a $2.0 million discrete benefit for excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by share-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected and $3.9 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.28BACKLOGAt September 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018, our current quarter backlog was approximately $417.6 million and $441.1 million, respectively. In backlog, we include orders with customer request dates within the next three months. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to customers. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog is not a reliable measure of future revenues. All backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments.FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financial ConditionCash flows were as follows: Three Months Ended September 29, 2018 September 23, 2017 (in thousands)Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$207,185 $219,705Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities97,378 (711,657)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(249,275) (177,009)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$55,288 $(668,961)Operating activitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities was $207.2 million in the three months ended September 29, 2018, a decrease of $12.5 million compared with the three months ended September 23, 2017. This decrease was due primarily to an increase of $23.6 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $12.6 million in other current assets, offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes, which resulted from higher revenue and improved gross margin. Investing activitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities and capital expenditures.Cash provided by investing activities was $97.4 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018, compared with cash used by investing activities of $711.7 million for the three months ended September 23, 2017, a change of $809.1 million. The change was due primarily to purchasing $525.4 million less available-for-sale-securities and an increase of $301.8 million in proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities during the three months ended September 29, 2018 compared to the three months ended September 23, 2017.Financing activitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of debt issuance, repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders.Net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $72.3 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 compared to the three months ended September 23, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $37.2 million in repurchases of our common stock and a $26.4 million increase in dividends paid to stockholders during the three months ended September 29, 2018.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of September 29, 2018, our available funds consisted of $2.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.29Current portion of debtOn November 21, 2013, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.5% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on November 15, 2018 (“2018 Notes”). The Company intends and has the ability to pay this debt upon maturity in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.Available Borrowing ResourcesWe have access to a $350 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on June 27, 2019. As of September 29, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility.Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsAs of September 29, 2018, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe Company's market risk has not changed materially from the interest rate and foreign currency risks disclosed in Item 7A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.The impact of inflation and changing prices on the Company's net revenues and on operating income during the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017 was not material.ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (“CEO”) and our chief financial officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as of September 29, 2018. Our management, including the CEO and the CFO, has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 29, 2018. The purpose of these controls and procedures is to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 29, 2018 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls A system of internal control over financial reporting is intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and no control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance. The design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect financial statement errors and misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 30PART II. OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGSThe information set forth above under Part I, Item 1, Note 11 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORSA description of risks associated with our business, financial condition and results of our operations is set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, which is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSOn July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this repurchase authorization.The following table summarizes the activity related to stock repurchases for the three months ended September 29, 2018: Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities (in thousands, except per share amounts) Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or ProgramsJul 1, 2018 - Jul 28, 2018554 $60.16 554 $585,052Jul 29, 2018 - Aug 25, 2018585 61.45 585 549,071Aug 26, 2018 - Sep 29, 2018723 59.75 723 505,861Total for the quarter1,862 $60.41 1,862 $505,861In the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock for approximately $112.5 million. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization of $505.9 million for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company's common stock and general market and business conditions.On October 30, 2018, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of the Company's common stock.
