BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 24, 2018. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019.On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders. Allowances for Client Receivables As of November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, total allowances recorded for client receivables were $55,163 and $49,913, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense was $102,713 and $106,151 for the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, total accumulated depreciation was $1,928,809 and $1,862,098, respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $68,879 and $81,854 for the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances. Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 (“Topic 606”) On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. Topic 606 has been applied to contracts that were not completed as of September 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after September 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting. See Note 2 (Revenues) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, we are now presenting total revenues and no longer reporting revenues before reimbursements. Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change in presentation. As a result of this change, for the three months ended November 30, 2017, both total revenues and cost of services decreased by $170,180 for hardware/software resale previously included in reimbursements. This change had no impact on operating income. The impact of adopting the new standard was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary impacts included additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash 8Table of ContentsACCENTURE PLCNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)(Unaudited)flows arising from client contracts, including judgments and changes in estimates. Upon adoption, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $6,451, net of a tax impact of $3,071, as of September 1, 2018.The impact of adopting the new standard for the three months ended November 30, 2018 was an increase to revenues of approximately $11.4 million. The impact on our balance sheet as of November 30, 2018 was not material with the exception of the classification of $2.1 billion of receivables and $572.3 million of contract assets, which were previously classified as Unbilled services, net.FASB ASU No. 2016-16 On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Upon adoption, we recorded deferred tax assets and an increase in retained earnings of $2,144,427, and we will recognize incremental income tax expense as these deferred tax assets are utilized. Our fiscal 2019 annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 3.3% higher due to the adoption. The adoption had no impact on cash flows. The impact of adoption as of September 1, 2018 of FASB ASU No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) and No. 2016-16 (Topic 740) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:  Balance as ofAugust 31, 2018 Adjustments Due to ASU 2014-09 (Topic 606) Adjustments Due to ASU 2016-16 (Topic 740) Balance as of September 1, 2018Balance Sheet       CURRENT ASSETS       Receivables from clients, net$4,996,454 $2,100,402 $— $7,096,856Unbilled services, net2,499,914 (2,499,914) — —Contract assets— 547,809 — 547,809Receivables and contract assets$7,496,368 $148,297 $— $7,644,665NON-CURRENT ASSETS       Unbilled services, net$23,036 $(23,036) $— $—Contract assets— 23,036 — 23,036Deferred contract costs705,124 (2,867) — 702,257Deferred income taxes, net2,086,807 3,071 2,144,427 4,234,305        CURRENT LIABILITIES       Deferred revenues2,837,682 154,952 — 2,992,634SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY       Retained earnings7,952,413 (6,451) 2,144,427 10,090,389FASB ASU No. 2017-07 On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance amends certain presentation and disclosure requirements for employers with defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans. The standard requires the service cost component of the net benefit cost to be in the same line item as other compensation in operating income and the other components of net benefit cost to be presented outside of operating income on a retrospective basis. Upon adoption, we reclassified $12 million for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and $58 million for fiscal 2018 of operating expenses to non-operating expense to conform with the fiscal 2019 treatment of these expenses. FASB ASU No. 2016-01 On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires investments previously accounted for under the cost method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value 9Table of ContentsACCENTURE PLCNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)(Unaudited)recognized in net income. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions. We adopted this standard using the prospective method. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting PronouncementThe following standard, issued by the FASB, will result in a change in practice and will have a financial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements:Standard Description Accenture Adoption Date Impact on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) The guidance amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The guidance requires either a modified retrospective transition method or a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. September 1, 2019 While we are continuing to assess the potential impact of this ASU, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office space operating leases. We anticipate this ASU will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but will not have a material impact on our other Consolidated Financial Statements or footnotes. We will apply the cumulative effect method.2. REVENUESWe account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on September 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service based on margins for similar services sold on a standalone basis. While determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligations require judgment, generally relative standalone selling prices and the separate performance obligations are readily identifiable as we sell those performance obligations unaccompanied by other performance obligations. Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration. If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately. If the modified services are not distinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Our revenues are derived from contracts for outsourcing services, technology integration consulting services and non-technology consulting services. These contracts have different terms based on the scope, performance obligations and complexity of the engagement, which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, fee-per-transaction contracts and contracts with multiple fee types.  The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. These variable amounts generally are awarded or refunded upon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metrics, milestones or cost targets and can be based upon client discretion. We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur. These estimates reflect the expected value of the variable fee and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time.  10Table of ContentsACCENTURE PLCNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)(Unaudited)Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. The majority of our revenues are recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligations. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the services to be provided. Outsourcing Contracts  Our outsourcing contracts typically span several years. Revenues are generally recognized on outsourcing contracts over time because our clients benefit from the services as they are performed. Outsourcing contracts require us to provide a series of distinct services each period over the contract term. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms.  Technology Integration Consulting Services Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design/redesign, build and implement new or enhanced systems and related processes for our clients are recognized over time as control of the system is transferred continuously to the client. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Generally, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client.   Non-Technology Integration Consulting Services Our contracts for non-technology integration consulting services are typically less than a year in duration.   Revenues are generally recognized over time as our clients benefit from the services as they are performed, or the contract includes termination provisions enabling payment for performance completed to date. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g. time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are generally recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. For non-technology integration consulting contracts which do not qualify to recognize revenue over time, we recognize revenues at a point in time when we satisfy our performance obligations and the client obtains control of the promised good or service.  On November 30, 2018, we had approximately $18 billion of remaining performance obligations. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 65% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in fiscal 2019, an additional 18% in fiscal 2020, and the balance thereafter. See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Contract Estimates Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored over the life of our contracts, and recorded revenues and cost estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a technology integration consulting contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods increased our revenues by approximately $53 million for the three months ended November 30, 2018. No 11Table of ContentsACCENTURE PLCNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)(Unaudited)adjustment on any one contract was material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended November 30, 2018. Contract Balances The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in Receivables, Contract assets, and Deferred revenues (Contract liabilities) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Our receivables are rights to consideration that are conditional only upon the passage of time as compared to our contract assets, which are rights to consideration conditional upon additional factors.  When we bill or receive payments from our clients before revenue is recognized, we record Contract liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. For some outsourcing contracts, we receive payments for transition or set-up activities, which are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are provided. These advance payments are typically not a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to complete its obligations under the contract. Deferred transition revenues were $571,060 and $581,395 as of November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $689,353 and $690,868 as of November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $48,983 and $9,534 for the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. 16Table of ContentsACCENTURE PLCNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)(Unaudited)Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows:  November 30, 2018 August 31, 2018Assets   Cash Flow Hedges   Other current assets$51,756 $29,380Other non-current assets21,782 1,065Other Derivatives   Other current assets32,794 28,700Total assets$106,332 $59,145Liabilities   Cash Flow Hedges   Other accrued liabilities$21,102 $50,870Other non-current liabilities19,679 64,365Other Derivatives   Other accrued liabilities3,744 25,455Total liabilities$44,525 $140,690Total fair value$61,807 $(81,545)Total notional value$7,906,411 $8,783,014We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows:  November 30, 2018 August 31, 2018Net derivative assets$80,782 $23,599Net derivative liabilities18,975 105,144Total fair value$61,807 $(81,545)Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We record these investments at cost and remeasure them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $117,442 as of November 30, 2018. Prior to the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-01, these investments were accounted for under the cost method. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 17Table of ContentsACCENTURE PLCNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)(Unaudited)9. INCOME TAXES On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized tax expense of $136,742, primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded additional tax expense of $40,927 resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act. We now consider our analysis and accounting for the Tax Act to be complete. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017 were 19.8% and 20.5%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2018 was primarily due to higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes partially offset by the impact of adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our SinnerSchrader AG subsidiary. As of November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, we have reflected the fair value of $43,015 and $46,703, respectively, related to redeemable common stock of the subsidiary in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $765,000 and $782,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $135,000 and $130,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of November 30, 2018, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.18Table of ContentsACCENTURE PLCNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)(Unaudited)11.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2019” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to: •Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. •Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. •If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. •We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks. •The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. •Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. •Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies. •Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 20Table of Contents•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.•Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.  •Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. •If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. •If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. •Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. •We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. •If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. •Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. •Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins. •Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. •We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. •We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. •Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 21Table of ContentsOverview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, U.K. pound and Japanese yen. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results.Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In connection with the adoption, we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements (net revenues). This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 9.5% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Resources, Communication, Media & Technology and Products, solid in Health & Public Service and slight in Financial Services. We experienced very strong growth in Growth Markets and North America and strong growth in Europe. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and strong in outsourcing during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. While the business environment remained competitive, we experienced pricing improvement in several areas of our business. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.In our consulting business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 8% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in Resources, strong growth in Communications, Media & Technology, Health & Public Service and Products and modest growth in Financial Services. Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.In our outsourcing business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in Communications, Media & Technology, Resources and Products, and slight growth in Health & Public Service, while growth in Financial Services remained flat. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and 22Table of Contentsintegration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.Utilization for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 92%, consistent with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 469,000 as of November 30, 2018, compared to approximately 435,000 as of November 30, 2017. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 15%, up from 13% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which required us to reclassify certain components of pension costs from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 31.1%, compared with 31.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 15.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with 15.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues were flat, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 10 basis points.Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 15.4%, compared with 15.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740). Upon adoption, we recorded deferred tax assets of $2.1 billion, and we will recognize incremental income tax expense going forward as these deferred tax assets are utilized. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” New Bookings New bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $10.2 billion, with consulting bookings of $5.9 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.3 billion.23Table of ContentsResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended November 30, 2018 Compared to the Three Months Ended November 30, 2017 Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources.

Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. In addition, we updated operating group results for fiscal 2018 to include an acquisition previously categorized within Other. Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018: Operating Groups •Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 14% in local currency, driven by growth in Software & Platforms across all geographic regions, led by North America.•Financial Services revenues increased 1% in local currency, driven by growth in both industries in Growth Markets as well as Insurance in North America, partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets in Europe.•Health & Public Service revenues increased 5% in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service in Europe and Growth Markets.•Products revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by growth across all geographic regions in Industrial as well as Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services in Europe and Growth Markets.•Resources revenues increased 21% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions led by Chemicals & Natural Resources and Energy.24Table of ContentsGeographic Regions •North America revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by the United States.•Europe revenues increased 6% in local currency, led by Italy, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain.•Growth Markets revenues increased 17% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as Brazil, China and Singapore.Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $590 million, or 7%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.6% from 84.8% during this period.Cost of Services Cost of services for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $488 million, or 7%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.9% from 69.0% during this period. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased to 31.1% from 31.0% during this period.Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $69 million, or 7%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 10.1% during this period.General and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $34 million, or 6%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 5.6% from 5.7% during this period. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $131 million, or 9%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:  Three Months Ended    November 30, 2018 November 30, 2017 (1)    OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin Increase(Decrease)  (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology$387 18% $298 16% $89Financial Services361 17 372 17 (11)Health & Public Service197 11 226 13 (28)Products438 15 413 15 25Resources246 15 190 14 56TOTAL$1,629 15.4% $1,498 15.2% $131_______________Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1)Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Certain components of pension service costs were reclassified from Operating expenses to Non-operating expenses. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was similar to that disclosed for revenue. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and revenue growth.•Financial Services operating income was relatively flat year-over-year.25Table of Contents•Health & Public Service operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability.Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 19.8%, compared with 20.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2018 was primarily due to higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes partially offset by the impact of adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2019 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $48 million, or 74%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $1.96 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with $1.79 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The $0.17 increase in our diluted earnings per share was due to an increase of $0.16 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.02 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Liquidity and Capital Resources As of November 30, 2018, Cash and cash equivalents was $4.4 billion, compared with $5.1 billion as of August 31, 2018. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:   Three Months Ended    November 30, 2018 November 30, 2017 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars)Net cash provided by (used in):     Operating activities$1,028 $1,006 $22Investing activities(273) (259) (14)Financing activities(1,462) (1,179) (283)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents10 (13) 23Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(698) $(445) $(252)_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $22 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a change in timing of certain compensation payments. 26Table of ContentsInvesting activities: Cash used in investing activities increased $14 million due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments, partially offset by lower spending on property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”Financing activities: The $283 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 7 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of November 30, 2018, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:  FacilityAmount BorrowingsUnderFacilities (in millions of U.S. dollars)Syndicated loan facility$1,000 $—Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities817 —Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit225 —Total$2,042 $—Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $333 million of letters of credit outstanding as of November 30, 2018.Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the three months ended November 30, 2018 was as follows:   Accenture plc Class AOrdinary Shares Accenture CanadaHoldings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts)Open-market share purchases (1)4,350,724 $706 — $—Other share purchase programs— — 4,700 1Other purchases (2)510,581 82 — —Total4,861,305 $788 4,700 $1_______________(1)We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2)During the three months ended November 30, 2018, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. 27Table of ContentsWe intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2019. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” New Accounting Pronouncements and Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 2 includes updates to our revenue policy as result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2014-09.ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK During the three months ended November 30, 2018, there were no material changes to the information on market risk exposure disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018. For a discussion of our market risk associated with foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk as of August 31, 2018, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting While we implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of FASB ASU No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) on our financial statements, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 28Table of ContentsPART II — OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1.

(2)Since August 2001, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized and periodically confirmed a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we purchased 4,350,724 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of $706 million. The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date. (3)As of November 30, 2018, our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $5,244 million, which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs. Since August 2001 and as of November 30, 2018, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $35,100 million for share purchases and redemptions by Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. (4)During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Accenture purchased 510,581 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans.
