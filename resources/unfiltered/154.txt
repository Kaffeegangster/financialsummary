SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY PLC 
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(Unaudited)   


1.
 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Organization  Seagate Technology plc (the “Company”)
is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Its principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products
including solid state drives (“SSDs”) and storage subsystems.  Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly
rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state
storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  The Company's HDD products are
designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where its products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge
non-compute applications, where its products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (“DVRs”),
network-attached storage (“NAS”), and gaming consoles. The Company's SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (“SAS”) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (“NVMe”) SSDs.
 The Company's enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the “cloud systems and solutions”) portfolio includes modular
original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.  Basis of
Presentation and Consolidation  The Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
all its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.  The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The methods, estimates and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its condensed
consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations,
comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for the periods presented. Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.  The
Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2018, are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) on August 3, 2018. The Company believes that the disclosures included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, when read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements as of

Revenue Recognition 
Effective June 30, 2018, the Company adopted a new revenue recognition policy in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”)
606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective transition approach as discussed in the section titled Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements in this Note 1. Prior to fiscal year 2019, the revenue
recognition policy was based on ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 606, the Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the
performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company
satisfies a performance obligation.  Revenue from sales of products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products, net of sales taxes. This typically occurs upon shipment from the Company. When applicable, the Company includes shipping charges billed to customers in Revenue
and includes the related shipping costs in Cost of revenue on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company
records estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to net revenue. Variable consideration generally consists of sales incentive programs, such as price protection and volume incentives aimed at increasing
customer demand. For OEM sales, rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an OEM customer's volume of purchases from Seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs.
For the distribution and retailing channel, these programs typically involve estimating the most likely amount of rebates related to a customer's level of sales, order size, advertising or point of sale activity as well as the expected value of
price protection adjustments based on historical analysis and forecasted pricing environment. Marketing development program costs are accrued and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. 
Practical Expedient and Exemptions  The Company elected a
practical expedient to expense sales commissions when the commissions are incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded as Marketing and administrative on the Company's Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
In February 2016 and July 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2016-02 (ASC Topic 842), Leases ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, and Leases, ASU 2018-11, Leases (ASC Topic 842), Target improvements, respectively. These ASUs amend a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than
one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The Company plans to
adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of these ASUs on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 (ASC Topic 326), Financial Instruments - Credit
Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU amends the requirement on the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The Company is required to adopt this guidance in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 (ASC Topic 220), Income Statement—Reporting
Comprehensive Income: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU was issued following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) and permits entities to
elect a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. The Company is required to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  In August 2018, the
FASB issued ASU 2018-15 (ASC Subtopic 350-40), Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software - Customer's
Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This ASU aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the
accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and FASB
also issued certain interpretive clarifications on this new guidance which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the revenue recognition guidance
under ASC 605. It also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers. This ASU became effective and was adopted by the Company in the September 2018 quarter retrospectively with a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit at the date of adoption (“modified retrospective transition approach”).
The Company has completed the adoption and implemented policies, processes and controls to support the new standard's measurement and disclosure requirements. 
The Company applied the ASC 606 using a modified retrospective transition approach to all contracts that were not completed as of June 29, 2018.
Results for reporting periods beginning June 30, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported under the historical accounting standard. As a result of the adoption, the Company
identified a change in revenue recognition timing on its product sales made to certain retail customers and started to recognize revenue when the Company transfers control to the applicable customers rather than deferring recognition until those
customers sell the products. In addition, the Company established accruals for the variable consideration related to customer incentives on these arrangements. On the date of initial adoption, the Company removed the related deferred income on the
product sales made to these customers and recorded estimates of the accrual for variable consideration through a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit. The cumulative effect of the change to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheet from the adoption of ASC 606 was as follows:

 The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements for
the September 2018 quarter was not material.  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 (ASC Subtopic 825-10), Financial Instruments—Overall Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, as amended by ASU 2018-03,
Financial Instruments—Overall: Technical Correction and Improvements, issued in February 2018. The amendments in these ASUs require entities to measure all equity investments at fair value with changes recognized
through net income. Additionally, the amendments eliminate certain disclosure requirements related to financial instruments measured at amortized cost and add disclosures related to the measurement categories of financial assets and financial
liabilities. These ASUs became effective and were adopted by the Company in the September 2018 quarter. For equity investments without readily determinable fair value, the Company elected the measurement alternative for measurement of equity
investments, defined as cost, less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer until the equity investments' fair value
becomes readily determinable. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 (ASC Topic 805), Business Combination: Clarifying
the Definition of a Business. The amendments in this ASU change the definition of a business to assist with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. The Company adopted the guidance in the September 2018 quarter.
The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  In May 2017, the FASB
issued ASU 2017-09 (ASC Topic 718), Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in this ASU provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a
share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The Company adopted the guidance in the September 2018 quarter. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and
disclosures.

 Investment in Debt Security  As
of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion investment in non-convertible preferred stock of Toshiba Memory Corporation (“TMC”, formerly known
as “K.K. Pangea”). The investment, with a contractual maturity of six years starting from May 31, 2018, is accounted for as
a held-to-maturity debt security, carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of transaction costs into interest income. Additionally, the debt security has
a contractual payment-in-kind (“PIK”) income which will be paid in cash upon redemption of the investment. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is
accrued into Interest income in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and added to the carrying value of the Investment in debt security on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three months ended
September 28, 2018, the PIK income earned was $16 million. No impairment was identified as of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018. Please refer to Note 8 - Fair Value for more details.

 Debt 
Short-Term Borrowings  The credit agreement entered into by the
Company and its subsidiary Seagate HDD Cayman on January 18, 2011 and subsequently amended (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) provides the Company with a $700 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The term of the
Revolving Credit Facility is through January 15, 2020. The loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a variable margin that will be determined based on the corporate credit rating of the Company.
The Company and certain of its material subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is available for cash borrowings, subject to compliance with certain covenants and other customary
conditions to borrowing, and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sub-limit of $75 million. 
The Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, includes three financial covenants: (1) minimum cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;
(2) a fixed charge coverage ratio; and (3) a net leverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with the modified covenants as of September 28, 2018 and expects to be in compliance for the next 12 months. 
As of September 28, 2018, no borrowings had been drawn or letters of credit utilized under the Revolving Credit Facility.

 Income Taxes 
The Company's income tax provision of $18 million in the three months ended September 28, 2018 included approximately $1 million of
net discrete tax expense.  The Company's income tax provision recorded for the three months ended September 28, 2018 differed from the
provision from income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S.
earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. 
During the three months ended September 28, 2018, the Company's unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties increased by
approximately $2 million to $62 million. The unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $62 million at September 28, 2018, subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals.
During the twelve months beginning September 29, 2018, the Company expects that its unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $19 million, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation. 
The Company's income tax provision of $7 million in the three months ended September 29, 2017 included approximately $1 million of
net discrete tax expense.  The Company's income tax provision recorded for the three months ended September 29, 2017 differed from the
provision from income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S.
earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law in the United States. The Tax Act significantly revises U.S. corporate income tax law by,
among other things, lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The U.S. tax law changes, including limitations on various business deductions such as executive
compensation under Internal Revenue Code §162(m), will not impact the Company's tax expense in the short-term due to the Company's large net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and associated valuation allowance. The Tax
Act's new international rules, including Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), Foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”), and Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax
(“BEAT”) are effective beginning in fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2019, the Company has included these effects of the Tax Act in its financial statements and concluded the impact will not be material. 
Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118 (regarding the application of ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”)
associated with the enactment of the Tax Act), the Company believes its accounting under ASC 740 for the provisions of the Tax Act is now complete.

 Restructuring and Exit Costs 
For the three months ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, the Company recorded restructuring charges of approximately
$23 million and $51 million, respectively, comprised primarily of charges related to workforce reduction costs and facilities and other exit costs associated with the restructuring of its workforce. The Company's significant
restructuring plans are described below. All restructuring charges are reported in Restructuring and other, net on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
December 2017 Plan — On December 8, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the “December 2017 Plan”) to reduce
its cost structure. The December 2017 Plan included reducing the Company's global headcount by approximately 500 employees. The December 2017 Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2018. 
July 2017 Plan — On July 25, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the “July 2017 Plan”) to reduce its cost
structure. The July 2017 Plan included reducing the Company's global headcount by approximately 600 employees. The July 2017 Plan was substantially completed during fiscal year 2018. 
March 2017 Plan — On March 9, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the “March 2017 Plan”) in connection with
the continued consolidation of its global footprint. The Company closed its design center in Korea, resulting in the reduction of the Company's headcount by approximately 300 employees. The March 2017 Plan was substantially completed by the end
of fiscal year 2017.  July 2016 Plan — On July 11, 2016, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the “July 2016
Plan”) for continued consolidation of its global footprint across Asia, EMEA and the Americas. The July 2016 Plan included reducing worldwide headcount by approximately 6,500 employees. The July 2016 Plan was substantially completed during

 Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and to a lesser extent, equity market risks relating to its ongoing business
operations. From time to time, the Company enters into cash flow hedges in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on forecasted expenses and investments denominated in
foreign currencies. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are classified as designated or non-designated hedging instruments. The
Company records all derivatives in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The changes in the fair value of highly effective designated cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. 
  17 



Table of Contents



Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments or are not assessed to be highly effective are adjusted to fair value through earnings. The amount of net unrealized gain on cash flow
hedges was $2 million as of September 28, 2018 and less than $1 million as of June 29, 2018.  The
Company de-designates its cash flow hedges when the forecasted hedged transactions affect earnings or it is probable the forecasted hedged transactions will not occur in the initially identified time
period. At such time, the associated gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are reclassified immediately into earnings and any subsequent changes in the fair
value of such derivative instruments are immediately reflected in earnings. The Company recognized a net gain of $1 million in Other expense, net related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three months
ended September 28, 2018. The Company did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three months ended September 29, 2017. 
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts that the Company uses to hedge the foreign
currency exposure on the investment in debt security and forecasted expenditures denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company recognizes gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in Other, net on its
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations along with foreign currency gains and losses on investment in debt security, and deferred gains of derivatives in Other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The following tables show the total notional value of the Company's outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of September 28,
2018 and June 29, 2018. All these foreign currency forward exchange contracts mature within 12 months.

 The Company is subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by
its employees as part of its Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan—the Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the “SDCP”). In fiscal year 2014, the Company entered into a Total Return
Swap (“TRS”) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities. The Company pays a floating rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS. The TRS is designed to
substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees. As of September 28, 2018, the notional investments underlying the TRS amounted to $120 million. The contract term
of the TRS is through January 2019 and is settled on a monthly basis, therefore limiting counterparty performance risk. The Company did not designate the TRS as a hedge. Rather, the Company records all changes in the fair value of the TRS to
earnings to offset the market value changes of the SDCP liabilities.

 Fair Value 
Measurement of Fair Value  Fair value is defined as the price
that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be
recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 
Fair Value Hierarchy  A fair value hierarchy is based on
whether the market participant assumptions used in determining fair value are obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) or reflects the Company's own assumptions of market participant valuation (unobservable inputs). A financial
instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: 
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities;  Level 2 — Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are inactive; quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; or 
Level 3 — Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
The Company considers an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide
pricing information on an ongoing basis, and views an inactive market as one in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market
makers. Where appropriate the Company's or the counterparty's non-performance risk is considered in determining the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively. 
Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  The
following tables present the Company's assets and liabilities, by financial instrument type and balance sheet line item that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, as of September 28, 2018:

 The Company classifies items in Level 1 if the financial assets consist of securities for which quoted prices are
available in an active market.  The Company classifies items in Level 2 if the financial asset or liability is valued using observable inputs.
The Company uses observable inputs including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets include: agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, municipal bonds, U.S. Treasuries, time deposits and
certificates of deposit. These debt investments are priced using observable inputs and valuation models which vary by asset class.

Table of Contents



The Company uses a pricing service to assist in determining the fair value of all of its cash equivalents and short-term investments. For the cash equivalents and short-term investments in the
Company's portfolio, multiple pricing sources are generally available. The pricing service uses inputs from multiple industry standard data providers or other third party sources and various methodologies, such as weighting and models, to
determine the appropriate price at the measurement date. The Company corroborates the prices obtained from the pricing service against other independent sources and, as of September 28, 2018, has not found it necessary to make any adjustments
to the prices obtained. The Company's derivative financial instruments are also classified within Level 2. The Company's derivative financial instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the TRS. The Company
recognizes derivative financial instruments in its condensed consolidated financial statements at fair value. The Company determines the fair value of these instruments by considering the estimated amount it would pay or receive to terminate these
agreements at the reporting date.  As of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the Company had no Level 3 assets or
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
From time to time, the Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These strategic
investments primarily include cost basis investments representing those where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence as well as equity method investments representing those where the Company does have the ability to
exercise significant influence but does not have control. These investments are included in Other assets, net in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are periodically analyzed to determine whether or not there are indicators
of impairment.  Prior to fiscal year 2019, the Company's strategic investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair
values were accounted for under the cost method and were recorded at historical cost at the time of investment, with adjustments to the balance only in the event of impairment. Effective June 30, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments, which changed the way the Company accounts for equity investments, excluding investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting. The Company's equity investments
in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values are now measured using the measurement alternative, defined by ASC 321, Investments - Equity Securities, as cost, less impairments, and adjusted up or down based on
observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Any adjustments resulting from impairments and/or observable price changes are recorded as Other, net in the Company's Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations.  As of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the carrying value of the Company's strategic
investments were $107 million and $118 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, the Company did not have any equity investments accounted for under the cost method that were
other-than-temporarily impaired and did not record any impairment charges. There were no upward or downward adjustments on equity investments as a result of adoption of measurement alternative during the September 2018 quarter. 
As of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the Company had $26 million of held for sale land and building (collectively, the
“property”) in Asia included in Other current assets on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The respective property to be sold met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the end of fiscal year 2017. During the September
2018 quarter, the Company accepted an offer to sell the property to a third party. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2019, subject to government approval and customary closing conditions. No impairment was identified for
the three months ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017.  Other Fair Value Disclosures 
The Company's investment in a debt security, classified
as held-to-maturity, represents shares of non-convertible preferred stock of TMC. This debt security has a
maturity date of six years starting from May 31, 2018 and is classified as Investment in debt security on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt security is recorded at amortized cost and its fair value approximated
the carrying value at June 29, 2018. As of September 28, 2018, the fair value of this investment was $1,289 million with an unrealized gain of $30 million on the carrying value of $1,259 million. The fair value was
determined utilizing Level 2 inputs such as discount rates and yield terms of similar types of securities issued by comparable companies.

Table of Contents


The Company's debt is carried at amortized cost. The estimated fair value of the
Company's debt is derived using the closing price of the same debt instruments as of the date of valuation, which takes into account the yield curve, interest rates and other observable inputs. Accordingly, these fair value measurements
are categorized as Level 2. The following table presents the fair value and amortized cost of the Company's debt in order of maturity:

 Equity 
Share Capital  The Company's authorized share capital is
$13,500 and consists of 1,250,000,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.00001, of which 286,127,032 shares were outstanding as of September 28, 2018, and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00001, of which none were issued or outstanding as
of September 28, 2018.  Ordinary shares – Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the
Company's board of directors (the “Board of Directors”). Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after required payments are made to holders of preferred shares, any remaining assets of the Company will be
distributed ratably to holders of the preferred and ordinary shares. Holders of shares are entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are entitled to vote, including the election of directors. 
Preferred shares – The Company may issue preferred shares in one or more series, up to the authorized amount, without shareholder approval.
The Board of Directors is authorized to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications,
limitations or restrictions. The Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the shareholders. 
The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred shares with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights
of the holders of the ordinary shares. The issuance of preferred shares, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a change in control of the Company and might harm the market price of its ordinary shares and the voting and other rights of the holders of ordinary shares. 
Repurchases of Equity Securities  All repurchases are effected
as redemptions in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association.  As of September 28, 2018, $0.7 billion remained available
for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit.  The following table sets forth information with respect to repurchases of the
Company's shares during the three months ended September 28, 2018:

 Share-based Compensation 
The Company recorded approximately $18 million and $32 million of share-based compensation expense during the three months ended
September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, respectively.

 Guarantees 
Indemnifications of Officers and Directors  On May 4, 2009,
Seagate Technology, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Seagate-Cayman”), then the parent company, entered into a new form of indemnification agreement (the “Revised
Indemnification Agreement”) with its officers and directors of Seagate-Cayman and its subsidiaries (each, an “Indemnitee”). The Revised Indemnification Agreement provides indemnification in addition to any of Indemnitee's
indemnification rights under Seagate-Cayman's Articles of Association, applicable law or otherwise, and indemnifies an Indemnitee for certain expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of Seagate-Cayman or any of its subsidiaries, arising out of his or her service as a director, officer, employee or agent of Seagate-Cayman or any
of its subsidiaries or of any other entity to which he or she provides services at Seagate-Cayman's request. However, an Indemnitee shall not be indemnified under the Revised Indemnification Agreement for (i) any fraud or dishonesty in the
performance of Indemnitee's duty to Seagate-Cayman or the applicable subsidiary of Seagate-Cayman or (ii) Indemnitee's conscious, intentional or willful failure to act honestly, lawfully and in good faith with a view to the best
interests of Seagate-Cayman or the applicable subsidiary of Seagate-Cayman. In addition, the Revised Indemnification Agreement provides that Seagate-Cayman will advance expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with enforcement of the Revised
Indemnification Agreement or with the investigation, settlement or appeal of any action or proceeding against him or her as to which he or she could be indemnified. 
On July 3, 2010, pursuant to a corporate reorganization, the common shareholders of Seagate-Cayman became ordinary shareholders of the Company and
Seagate-Cayman became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as described more fully in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 6, 2010 (the “Redomestication”).
On July 27, 2010, in connection with the Redomestication, the Company, as sole shareholder of Seagate-Cayman, approved a form of deed of indemnity (the “Deed of Indemnity”), which provides for the indemnification by Seagate-Cayman of
any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, Seagate-Cayman or any subsidiary of the Company (each, a “Deed Indemnitee”), in addition to any indemnification rights of a Deed Indemnitee under the Company's Articles of
Association, applicable law or otherwise, with a similar scope to the Revised Indemnification Agreement. Seagate-Cayman entered into Deeds of Indemnity with certain Deed Indemnitees effective as of July 3, 2010 and continues to enter into Deeds
of Indemnity with additional Deed Indemnitees from time to time.  The nature of these indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a
reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay on behalf of its officers and directors. Historically, the Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been
accrued in the Company's consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.  Intellectual Property Indemnification
Obligations  The Company has entered into agreements with customers and suppliers that include limited intellectual property indemnification
obligations that are customary in the industry. These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these
transactions. The nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers and suppliers. Historically, the
Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.

Product Warranty 
The Company estimates probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its products for a period of 1 to
5 years. The Company uses estimated repair or replacement costs and uses statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine its warranty obligation. Changes in the Company's product warranty liability during the three
months ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017 were as follows:

 Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period and the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially
dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding options, unvested restricted stock units and performance-based share units and shares to be purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).
The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in fair market value of the Company's share price can
result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to the shareholders of the Company:

The Company assesses the probability of an unfavorable outcome of all its material litigation, claims, or assessments to determine whether a liability had
been incurred and whether it is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss. In the event that an unfavorable outcome is determined to be probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the
Company establishes an accrual for the litigation, claim or assessment. In addition, in the event an unfavorable outcome is determined to be less than probable, but reasonably possible, the Company will disclose an estimate of the possible loss or
range of such loss; however, when a reasonable estimate cannot be made, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect. Litigation is inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions. Additionally, the Company may enter into
settlements or be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially.

Intellectual Property Litigation 
Convolve, Inc. (“Convolve”) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) v. Seagate
Technology LLC, et al. On July 13, 2000, Convolve and MIT filed suit against Compaq Computer Corporation and Seagate Technology LLC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging
infringement of U.S. Patent No. 4,916,635 (the “‘635 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 5,638,267 (the “‘267 patent”), misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and other claims. On January 16,
2002, Convolve filed an amended complaint, alleging defendants were infringing U.S. Patent No. 6,314,473 (the “‘473 patent”). The district court ruled in 2010 that the ‘267 patent was out of the case. 
On August 16, 2011, the district court granted in part and denied in part the Company's motion for summary judgment. On July 1, 2013, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit: 1) affirmed the district court's summary judgment rulings that Seagate did not misappropriate any of the alleged trade secrets and that the asserted claims of the ‘635 patent are invalid;
2) reversed and vacated the district court's summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to the ‘473 patent; and 3) remanded the case for further proceedings on the
‘473 patent. On July 11, 2014, the district court granted the Company's further summary judgment motion regarding the ‘473 patent. On February 10, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit: 1) affirmed the
district court's summary judgment of no direct infringement by Seagate because Seagate's ATA/SCSI disk drives do not meet the “user interface” limitation of the asserted claims of the ‘473 patent; 2) affirmed the district
court's summary judgment of non-infringement by Compaq's products as to claims 1, 3, and 5 of the ‘473 patent because Compaq's F10 BIOS interface does not meet the
“commands” limitation of those claims; 3) vacated the district court's summary judgment of non-infringement by Compaq's accused products as to
claims 7-15 of the ‘473 patent; 4) reversed the district court's summary judgment of non-infringement based on intervening rights; and 5)
remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on the ‘473 patent. In view of the rulings made by the district court and the Court of Appeals and the uncertainty regarding the amount of damages, if any, that could be awarded
Convolve in this matter, the Company does not believe that it is currently possible to determine a reasonable estimate of the possible range of loss related to this matter. 
Lambeth Magnetic Structures LLC v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc., et al. On April 29, 2016, Lambeth Magnetic Structures LLC filed a
complaint against Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. and Seagate Technology LLC in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,128,988, “Magnetic Material Structures,
Devices and Methods.” The Company believes the claims asserted in the complaint are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this case. The court issued its claim construction ruling on October 18, 2017. No trial date has been
set. While the possible range of loss for this matter remains uncertain, the Company estimates the amount of loss to be immaterial to the financial statements. 
Environmental Matters  The Company's operations are
subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup
of contaminated sites. Some of the Company's operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. 
The Company has established environmental management systems and continually updates its environmental policies and standard operating procedures for its
operations worldwide. The Company believes that its operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. The Company budgets for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with
environmental laws. If additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on the Company in the future, it could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures. 
Some environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund”
law) and its state equivalents, can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator
owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. The Company has been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites. At each of these sites, the
Company has an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties. The Company has fulfilled its responsibilities at
some of these sites and remains involved in only a few at this time.  While the Company's ultimate costs in connection with these sites is
difficult to predict with complete accuracy, based on its current estimates of cleanup costs and its expected allocation of these costs, the Company does not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material.

The Company may be subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing
the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. For example, the European Union (“EU”) enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
Equipment, which prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, in certain products, including disk drives and server storage products, put on the market after July 1, 2006. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other
jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, China, Japan and others. The European Union REACH Directive (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals, EC 1907/2006) also restricts substances of
very high concern (“SVHCs”) in products. If the Company or its suppliers fails to comply with the substance restrictions, recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide, it could have a materially
adverse effect on the Company's business.  Other Matters 
The Company is involved in a number of other judicial, regulatory or administrative proceedings and investigations incidental to its business, and the
Company may be involved in such proceedings and investigations arising in the normal course of its business in the future. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 Critical Accounting Policies. Accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding
the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.  Our Company 
We are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard
drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (“SSD”) and storage subsystems. 
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary
medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and
most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  Our HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage
systems; edge compute applications, where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end
user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (“DVRs”), network-attached storage (“NAS”) and gaming consoles. Our SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI
(“SAS”) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (“NVMe”) SSDs.  Our enterprise data solutions
(formerly referred to as the “cloud systems and solutions”) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) storage systems and scale-out storage servers. 
Overview of the September 2018 Quarter  During the September
2018 quarter, we shipped 99 exabytes of HDD storage capacity. We generated revenue of approximately $3.0 billion, gross margin of 31% and our operating cash flow was $587 million. We paid $181 million in dividends and repurchased
3 million of our ordinary shares for $150 million.

 Revenue in the September 2018 quarter increased by $156 million from the June 2018 quarter as a result of an
increase in exabytes shipped driven primarily by higher seasonal demand for our client and consumer markets, partially offset by price erosion. 
Revenue in the September 2018 quarter increased by $359 million from the September 2017 quarter as a result of an increase in exabytes shipped
driven primarily by higher demand for our enterprise and client markets, partially offset by price erosion.  We maintain various sales programs such
as channel rebates and price masking. Sales programs were approximately 11%, 12% and 11% of gross drive revenue for the September 2018 quarter, June 2018 quarter and September 2017 quarter, respectively. Adjustments to revenues due to under or over
accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1% of quarterly gross revenue in all periods presented.  Cost

 Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the September 2018 quarter decreased by approximately 100 basis points from
the June 2018 quarter primarily due to a decline in prices for NAND flash memory and general price erosion. Compared to the September 2017 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased by 300 basis points primarily driven by favorable
product mix and improved factory utilization as a result of higher demand for our enterprise and client markets, partially offset by a decline in prices for NAND flash memory and general price erosion. 
In the September 2018 quarter, total warranty cost was 0.7% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of 0.5% of
revenue due to improvements in return rates on newer generation products. Warranty cost related to new shipments was 1.2%, 1.3% and 1.3% of revenue for the September 2018, June 2018 and September 2017 quarters, respectively.

 Product development expense. Product development expense for the September 2018 quarter remained relatively
flat compared to the June 2018 quarter and the September 2017 quarter.  Marketing and administrative expense. Marketing and
administrative expense for the September 2018 quarter decreased by $25 million from the June 2018 quarter primarily due to a $13 million decrease in variable compensation and share-based compensation expenses, a $5 million decrease in
salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods and a $7 million decrease in other general expenses due to related operational efficiencies. 
Compared to the September 2017 quarter, Marketing and administrative expense decreased by $30 million primarily due to a $13 million decrease
in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $9 million decrease in other general expenses due to related operational efficiencies and an $8 million decrease in variable
compensation and share-based compensation expenses.  Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles for the September 2018
quarter remained flat compared to the June 2018 quarter. Amortization of intangibles for the September 2018 quarter decreased by $16 million from the September 2017 quarter due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful life.
 Restructuring and other, net. Restructuring and other, net for the September 2018 quarter was comprised of charges primarily related to a
voluntary early exit program.  Restructuring and other, net for the June 2018 quarter included a gain of $24 million from the sale of certain
properties previously classified as held for sale, offset by restructuring charges announced in prior periods.  Restructuring and other, net for the
September 2017 quarter was comprised of restructuring charges to reduce our global workforce by 600 employees.  Other Expense, Net

 Our income tax provision of $18 million for the September 2018 quarter included approximately $1 million of net
discrete tax expense.

Our income tax provision recorded for the September 2018 quarter differed from the provision from
income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings
generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. 
During the three months ended September 28, 2018 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties increased by approximately
$2 million to $62 million. The unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $62 million at September 28, 2018, subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals. During the 12
months beginning September 29, 2018, we expect that our unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $19 million, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation. 
Our income tax provision of $7 million recorded for the September 2017 quarter included approximately $1 million of net discrete tax expense.
 Our income tax provision recorded for the September 2017 quarter differed from the provision from income taxes that would be derived by applying the
Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax
holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law in the United States. The Tax Act significantly revises U.S. corporate income tax law by,
among other things, lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.  The U.S. tax law changes, including limitations on various business deductions such as
executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code §162(m), will not impact our tax expense in the short-term due to our large net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and associated valuation allowance. The Tax Act's new international
rules, including Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), Foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”), and Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (“BEAT”) are effective beginning in
fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2019, we have included these effects of the Tax Act in our financial statements and have concluded the impact will not be material. 
Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118 (regarding the application of ASC 740 associated with the enactment of the Tax Act), we
believe our accounting under ASC 740 for the provisions of the Tax Act is now complete.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
The following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources. Our
cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Our short-term investments consist primarily of money market funds, time deposits and certificates of deposit. The
principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We operate in some countries that have restrictive
regulations over the movement of cash and/or foreign exchange across their borders. However, we believe our sources of cash have been and will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months. We are not aware of any
downgrades, losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or short-term investments and we do not believe the fair value of our short-term investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of
September 28, 2018.  Cash and Cash Equivalents

 Our cash and cash equivalents increased from June 29, 2018 as a result of an increase in the net cash provided by
operating activities, partially offset by net cash outflows for dividends paid to our shareholders of $181 million, capital expenditures of $177 million and repurchases of our ordinary shares of $150 million. 
Cash Provided by Operating Activities  Cash provided by
operating activities for the three months ended September 28, 2018 was $587 million and includes the effects of net income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation, amortization,
share-based compensation and:   


 
•
 
 an increase of $119 million in accounts payable, primarily due to higher material purchases;

•
 
 partially offset by a decrease of $79 million in accrued employee compensation primarily due to cash paid to our
employees as part of our variable compensation plans; and   


 
•
 
 an increase of $66 million in inventory, primarily due to an increase in units built. 
Cash Used in Investing Activities  Cash used in investing
activities for the three months ended September 28, 2018 was $176 million, which was primarily attributable to the payments for the purchase of property, equipment and leasehold improvements of $177 million. 
Cash Used in Financing Activities  Cash used in financing
activities of $326 million for the three months ended September 28, 2018 was primarily attributable to the following activities:   


 
•
 
 $181 million in dividend payments; 
 


 
•
 
 $150 million paid to repurchase ordinary shares; and 
 


 
•
 
 $27 million paid for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards; 
 


 
•
 
 partially offset by $32 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans.
 Liquidity Sources, Cash Requirements and Commitments 
Our primary sources of liquidity as of September 28, 2018 consisted of: (1) approximately $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents,
(2) cash we expect to generate from operations and (3) a $700 million senior revolving credit facility.  As of September 28,
2018, no borrowings had been drawn under the revolving credit facility or had been utilized for letters of credit issued under this credit facility. The line of credit is available for borrowings, subject to compliance with financial covenants and
other customary conditions to borrowing.  The credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility, as amended, includes three financial
covenants: (1) minimum cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio; and (3) a net leverage ratio. The term of the revolving credit facility is through January 15, 2020. We were in
compliance with the modified covenants as of September 28, 2018 and expect to be in compliance for the next 12 months.  Our liquidity
requirements are primarily to meet our working capital, product development and capital expenditure needs, to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic
investments. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined by future operating performance, and therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other
factors, some of which are beyond our control.  For fiscal year 2019, we expect capital expenditures to remain below our long-term targeted range of
6% to 8% of revenue.  From time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding notes in open market or privately negotiated purchases or otherwise,
or we may repurchase outstanding notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture.  Dividends declared in the September 2018 quarter of
$180 million were subsequently paid on October 3, 2018. The Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.63 per share on November 2, 2018, which is payable on January 2, 2019 to shareholders of
record at the close of business on December 19, 2018.  From time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through
private, open market, tender offers broker-assisted purchases or other means. As of September 28, 2018, $0.7 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit. All repurchases are effected as
redemptions in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association. On October 29, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $2.3 billion of our outstanding ordinary shares.

Critical Accounting Policies 
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period
and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future
results may vary from our estimates.  Other than as described in Note 1. “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no other material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates. Refer to “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2018, as filed with the SEC on
August 3, 2018, for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
See “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”
for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements.

ITEM 3.
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
We have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit rating changes, equity and bond markets.
A portion of these risks may be hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  Interest Rate
Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio including investment in debt security in Toshiba Memory Corporation (“TMC”, formerly known as “K.K.
Pangea”). As of September 28, 2018, we had no impairment for our investment in debt security and we had no available-for-sale debt securities that
had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months. We determined no available-for-sale debt securities were
other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 28, 2018.  We have fixed rate debt obligations. We enter into debt obligations for general
corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs.  The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average
interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of September 28, 2018.

 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. From time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures. Our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. At this
time, we have not identified any material exposure associated with the potential changes related to the British vote to exit the European Union.  We
hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Our foreign currency
forward exchange contracts include an aggregate notional amount of 139.5 billion Japanese Yen ($1.3 billion at September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018), to hedge foreign exchange fluctuations of our investment principal in non-convertible preferred stock debt security of TMC. We did not designate these contracts as hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging and, therefore, the change
in fair value of these contracts is recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities. All foreign currency forward exchange contracts discussed above mature within 12 months. 
We evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts include a notional amount of
approximately 7 billion Japanese Yen ($66 million at June 29, 2018), to hedge the PIK income related to TMC investment, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. As of September 29, 2018, $22 million was de-designated and included in contracts not designated as hedges.  We did not have any material net gains or losses
recognized in Other expense, net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during the three months ended September 28, 2018.

Other Market Risks. We have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange
contracts and our fixed income portfolio. We monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations. We also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any
one counterparty, and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institution. Additionally, the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. 
Changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our near term financial results, but downgrades may negatively impact our future
ability to raise capital, increase the cost of such capital and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties.  We have an
investment in debt security of $1.3 billion carried at amortized cost. We review our debt security for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such asset below carrying value is other-than-temporary. 
We are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our Seagate
Deferred Compensation Plan (the “SDCP”). In fiscal year 2014, we entered into a Total Return Swap (“TRS”) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities. We pay a floating rate, based on LIBOR
plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS. The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees. See
“Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 7. Derivative Financial Instruments” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 


ITEM 4.
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
As required by the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, as of September 28, 2018 we carried out an evaluation under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on the evaluation, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 28, 2018. 
In connection with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in the September 2018 quarter, we implemented internal controls to ensure that
the necessary revenue contracts, policies and process flows were reviewed to identify the impact of adoption. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition
standard. During the quarter ended September 28, 2018, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
