Today our strategy, products, and employees are delivering on that ambition with strong growth, record results, and new opportunities. We are gaining share in an expanded total addressable market (TAM) opportunity, which is now expected to be over $300 billion2 as our transformation accelerates.•Our data-centric businesses collectively grew 22% led by the growth in the cloud and communication service provider market segments. To extend the growth momentum, we are now shipping Intel® Optane™ data center persistent memory, which combines the speed of traditional memory with the capacity and native persistence of storage. •Our focus on performance leadership and differentiation in client computing is producing outstanding results. In addition, we expect modest PC TAM2 growth this year and continued share gain in modems. To extend product leadership and to deliver more value to customers, we launched new 9th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, targeting the growing gaming market segment. •The return to PC TAM growth put pressure on our factory network. In addition to prioritizing production to serve server and high-performance PC market segments, we are investing additional capital expenditure to increase our supply, working with customers to align demand with available supply, and making good progress to improve 10nm yields. •30 years ago, in September, 1988, Gordon Moore helped establish the Intel Foundation, a public charity funded by our company. From investing in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs, providing disaster relief, and amplifying the philanthropy of Intel employees, the Intel Foundation has been committed to improving lives around the world. 1 See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within Other Key Information.2 Source: Intel calculated 2022 TAM and current year PC TAM derived from industry analyst reports and internal estimates.A QUARTER IN REVIEW 2Table of ContentsINTEL CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF INCOME   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended(In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts; Unaudited) Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017 Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017Net revenue $19,163 $16,149 $52,191 $45,708Cost of sales 6,803 6,085 19,681 17,388Gross margin 12,360 10,064 32,510 28,320Research and development 3,428 3,209 10,110 9,782Marketing, general and administrative 1,605 1,661 5,230 5,610Restructuring and other charges (72) 4 (72) 189Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 50 49 150 124Operating expenses 5,011 4,923 15,418 15,705Operating income 7,349 5,141 17,092 12,615Gains (losses) on equity investments, net (75) 846 365 1,440Interest and other, net (132) (57) 225 262Income before taxes 7,142 5,930 17,682 14,317Provision for taxes 744 1,414 1,824 4,029Net income $6,398 $4,516 $15,858 $10,288Earnings per share – Basic $1.40 $0.96 $3.42 $2.19Earnings per share – Diluted $1.38 $0.94 $3.35 $2.12Cash dividends declared per share of common stock $0.60 $0.5450 $1.20 $1.0775Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding:        Basic 4,574 4,688 4,632 4,707Diluted 4,648 4,821 4,728 4,849See accompanying notes.

We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our consolidated condensed financial statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 Form 10-K. NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIESWe assess the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on our financial statements. The sections below describe impacts from newly adopted standards as well as material updates to our previous assessments, if any, from our 2017 Form 10-K. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTEDRetirement Benefits - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit CostStandard/Description: This amended standard was issued to provide additional guidance on the presentation of net periodic benefit cost in the income statement and on the components eligible for capitalization in assets. In accordance with the revised standard, we have separated the different components of net periodic benefit cost, presenting service cost components within operating income and other non-service components separately outside of operating income on the income statement. In addition, only service costs are now eligible for inventory capitalization.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2018. Changes to the presentation of benefit costs were required to be adopted retrospectively, while changes to the capitalization of service costs into inventories were required to be adopted prospectively. The standard permits, as a practical expedient, use of the amounts disclosed in the Retirement Benefit Plans footnote for the prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirement.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Adoption of the amended standard resulted in the reclassification of approximately $114 million of non-service net periodic benefit costs from line items within operating income to interest and other, net, for the year ended December 30, 2017 ($259 million for the year ended December 31, 2016). Revenue Recognition - Contracts with CustomersStandard/Description: This standard was issued to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by all companies. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2018. This standard was adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Our adoption assessments identified a change in revenue recognition timing on our component sales made to distributors. Under the new standard we now recognize revenue when we deliver to the distributor rather than deferring recognition until the distributor sells the components. On the date of initial application, we removed the deferred income and related receivables on component sales made to distributors through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. The revenue deferral that was historically recognized in the following period is expected to be primarily offset by the acceleration of revenue recognition in the current period as control of the product transfers to our customer.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements7Table of ContentsOur assessment also identified a change in expense recognition timing related to payments we make to our customers for distinct services they perform as part of cooperative advertising programs, which were previously recorded as operating expenses. We now recognize the expense for cooperative advertising in the period the marketing activities occur. Previously we recognized the expense in the period the customer was entitled to participate in the program, which coincided with the period of sale. On the date of initial adoption, we capitalized the expense of cooperative advertising not performed through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. We have completed our adoption and implemented policies, processes, and controls to support the standard's measurement and disclosure requirements. Refer to the tables below, which summarize the impacts of the changes discussed above to our financial statements recorded as an adjustment to opening balances for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017, and also provide comparative reporting of the impacts of adopting the standard.Accounting Policy Updates: We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales.We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Any variable consideration is recognized as a reduction of net revenue at the time of revenue recognition. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. The impacts of distributor sales price reductions resulting from price protection agreements are also estimated based on historical analysis of such activity and are reflected as a reduction in net revenue. We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs, such as our Intel Inside® program, for marketing activities for certain of our products. We generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as expense when the marketing activities occur. Financial Instruments - Recognition and MeasurementStandard/Description: Requires changes to the accounting for financial instruments that primarily affect equity securities, financial liabilities measured using the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for such instruments.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2018. Changes to our marketable equity securities were required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017. Since management has elected to apply the measurement alternative to non-marketable equity securities, changes to these securities were adopted prospectively.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Marketable equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale equity investments are now measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through the income statement.All non-marketable equity securities formerly classified as cost method investments are measured and recorded using the measurement alternative. Equity securities measured and recorded using the measurement alternative are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Adjustments resulting from impairments and qualifying observable price changes are recorded in the income statement.Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, in accordance with the standard, recurring fair value disclosures are no longer provided for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative. In addition, the existing impairment model has been replaced with a new one-step qualitative impairment model. No initial adoption adjustment was recorded for these instruments since the standard was required to be applied prospectively for securities measured using the measurement alternative.We have completed our adoption and implemented policies, processes, and controls to support the standard's measurement and disclosure requirements. Refer to the table below, which summarizes impacts, net of tax, of the changes discussed above to our financial statements. This reflects an adjustment to opening balances for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017. Accounting Policy Updates: We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:•Marketable equity securities are equity securities with readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value. Prior to fiscal 2018, these securities were measured and recorded at fair value and classified as available-for-sale securities. •Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative which measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. These securities were previously accounted for using the cost method of accounting, measured at cost less other-than-temporary impairment. •Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements8Table of ContentsRealized and unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in value and sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. We previously recorded unrealized gains and losses through other comprehensive income (loss) and realized gains and losses on the sale, exchange or impairment of these equity investments through gains (losses) on equity investments, net.The carrying value of our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities totaled $2.9 billion as of September 29, 2018 ($2.6 billion as of December 30, 2017). The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include industry and market conditions, the financial performance and near-term prospects of the investee, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our equity investments using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. Prior to fiscal 2018, non-marketable equity securities were tested for impairment using the other-than-temporary impairment model which considered the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. Impairments of equity investments were $372 million in the first nine months of 2018 and $613 million in the first nine months of 2017.Opening Balance AdjustmentsThe following table summarizes the effects of adopting Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Customers, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement, and other accounting standards on our financial statements for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017 as an adjustment to the opening balance:    Adjustments from  (In Millions) Balance as ofDec 30, 2017 Revenue Standard Financial Instruments Standard Other1  Opening Balance as ofDec 31, 2017Assets:          Accounts receivable $5,607 $(530) $— $— $5,077Inventories $6,983 $47 $— $— $7,030Other current assets $2,908 $64 $— $(8) $2,964Equity investments $— $— $8,579 $— $8,579Marketable equity securities $4,192 $— $(4,192) $— $—Other long-term assets $7,602 $— $(4,387) $(43) $3,172           Liabilities:          Deferred income $1,656 $(1,356) $— $— $300Other accrued liabilities $7,535 $81 $— $— $7,616Deferred income taxes $3,046 $191 $— $(20) $3,217           Stockholders' equity:          Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $862 $— $(1,745) $(45) $(928)Retained earnings $42,083 $665 $1,745 $14 $44,5071 Includes adjustments from adoption of "Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory" and "Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income - Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements9Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the impacts of adopting the new revenue standard on our consolidated condensed statements of income and balance sheets:  Three Months Ended September 29, 2018 Nine Months Ended September 29, 2018(In Millions) As reported Adjustments Without new revenue standard As reported Adjustments Without new revenue standardIncome Statement                         Net revenue $19,163 $118 $19,281 $52,191 $(266) $51,925Cost of sales 6,803 46 6,849 19,681 (136) 19,545Gross margin 12,360 72 12,432 32,510 (130) 32,380Marketing, general and administrative 1,605 — 1,605 5,230 (70) 5,160Operating income 7,349 72 7,421 17,092 (60) 17,032Income before taxes 7,142 72 7,214 17,682 (60) 17,622Provision for taxes 744 20 764 1,824 (4) 1,820Net income $6,398 $52 $6,450 $15,858 $(56) $15,802                 As of September 29, 2018(In Millions)       As reported Adjustments Without new revenue standardBalance Sheet                         Assets:            Accounts receivable       $5,457 $446 $5,903Inventories       $7,401 $23 $7,424Other current assets       $3,546 $4 $3,550             Liabilities:            Deferred income       $— $1,668 $1,668Other accrued liabilities       $9,835 $(334) $9,501Deferred income taxes       $1,485 $(140) $1,345             Equity:            Retained earnings       $47,094 $(721) $46,373ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTEDLeasesStandard/Description: This new lease accounting standard requires that we recognize leased assets and corresponding liabilities on the balance sheet and provide enhanced disclosure of lease activity.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2019. The standard requires a modified retrospective adoption. We can choose to apply the provisions at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements or at the beginning of the period of adoption. We have elected to apply the guidance at the beginning of the period of adoption.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: We expect the valuation of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, previously described as operating leases, to approximate the present value of our forecasted future lease commitments. We are currently implementing processes to comply with the measurement and disclosure requirements.Cloud Computing Implementation CostsStandard/Description: The standard requires implementation costs incurred in cloud computing (i.e. hosting) arrangements that are service contracts to be assessed under existing guidance to determine which costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2020. The standard requires adoption either retrospectively or prospectively. Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: We have not yet determined the impact of this standard on our financial statements. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements10Table of ContentsNOTE 3: OPERATING SEGMENTS We manage our business through the following operating segments:•Client Computing Group (CCG)•Data Center Group (DCG)•Internet of Things Group (IOTG)•Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG)•Programmable Solutions Group (PSG)•All OtherDuring the third quarter of 2018, we made an organizational change to combine our artificial intelligence investments in edge computing with IOTG; accordingly, approximately $480 million of goodwill was reallocated from "all other" to the IOTG operating segment.We offer platform products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone System-on-Chip (SoC), or a multichip package. A platform product may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services offered by Intel. Platform products are used in various form factors across our CCG, DCG, and IOTG operating segments. We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products, which are our principal products and considered as one class of product. CCG and DCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. The “all other” category includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:•results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, including Mobileye results;•historical results of operations from divested businesses, including Intel Security Group (ISecG) results; •results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business;   •amounts included within restructuring and other charges;  •a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and •acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), which is our interim Chief Executive Officer, does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except for these differences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements11Table of ContentsNet revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:  Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended(In Millions) Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017 Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017Net revenue:        Client Computing Group        Platform $9,023 $8,132 $24,703 $23,163Adjacent 1,211 728 2,479 1,886  10,234 8,860 27,182 25,049Data Center Group        Platform 5,637 4,439 15,561 12,344Adjacent 502 439 1,361 1,138  6,139 4,878 16,922 13,482Internet of Things Group        Platform 855 680 2,319 1,926Adjacent 64 169 320 364  919 849 2,639 2,290Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group 1,081 891 3,200 2,631Programmable Solutions Group 496 469 1,511 1,334All other 294 202 737 922Total net revenue $19,163 $16,149 $52,191 $45,708         Operating income (loss):        Client Computing Group $4,532 $3,600 $10,557 $9,656Data Center Group 3,082 2,255 8,421 5,403Internet of Things Group 321 146 791 390Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group 160 (52) 14 (291)Programmable Solutions Group 106 113 304 302All other (852) (921) (2,995) (2,845)Total operating income $7,349 $5,141 $17,092 $12,615Disaggregated net revenue for each period was as follows:  Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended(In Millions) Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017 Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017Platform revenue        Desktop platform $3,225 $2,967 $9,087 $8,598Notebook platform 5,774 5,123 15,549 14,437DCG platform 5,637 4,439 15,561 12,344Other platform1 879 722 2,386 2,054  15,515 13,251 42,583 37,433         Adjacent revenue2 3,648 2,898 9,608 7,741ISecG divested business — — — 534Total revenue $19,163 $16,149 $52,191 $45,7081 Includes our tablet, service provider, and IOTG platform revenue.2 Includes all of our non-platform products for CCG, DCG, and IOTG like modem, ethernet, and silicon photonics, as well as NSG, PSG, and Mobileye products.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements12Table of ContentsNOTE 4: EARNINGS PER SHARE We computed basic earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period.   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended(In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017 Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017Net income available to common stockholders $6,398 $4,516 $15,858 $10,288Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding – basic 4,574 4,688 4,632 4,707Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans 40 34 52 43Dilutive effect of convertible debt 34 99 44 99Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding – diluted 4,648 4,821 4,728 4,849Earnings per share – Basic $1.40 $0.96 $3.42 $2.19Earnings per share – Diluted $1.38 $0.94 $3.35 $2.12 Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs), and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. In December 2017, we paid cash to satisfy the conversion of our 2035 debentures, which we excluded from our dilutive earnings per share computation starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and are no longer dilutive. Our 2039 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion. Since the conversion premium is paid in cash or stock at our option, we determined the potentially dilutive shares of common stock by applying the treasury stock method. For the nine months ended September 29, 2018, we paid cash to satisfy the conversion of a portion of our 2039 debentures. The potentially dilutive shares associated with the converted portion are excluded from our diluted earnings per share computation in 2018 as they are no longer dilutive. In all periods presented, potentially dilutive outstanding securities which would have been antidilutive are insignificant and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. In all periods presented, we included our outstanding 2039 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because the average market price was above the conversion price. We could potentially exclude the 2039 debentures in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price.NOTE 5: CONTRACT LIABILITIES(In Millions) Sep 29, 2018 Opening Balance as of Dec 31, 2017Contract liabilities from prepaid supply agreements $2,692 $105Contract liabilities from software, services and other 93 195Total contract liabilities $2,785 $300Contract liabilities are primarily related to partial prepayments received from customers on long-term supply agreements towards future NSG product delivery. As new prepaid supply agreements are entered into and performance obligations are negotiated, this component of the contract liability balance will increase, and as customers purchase product and utilize their prepaid balances, the balance will decrease. The short-term portion of prepayments from supply agreements is reported on the consolidated condensed balance sheets within other accrued liabilities.The following table shows the changes in contract liability balances relating to prepaid supply agreements during the first nine months of 2018:(In Millions)  Prepaid supply agreements balance as of December 31, 2017 $105Additions and adjustments 2,753Revenue recognized (166)Prepaid supply agreements balance as of September 29, 2018 $2,692Additions and adjustments in the first nine months of 2018 include a $1.0 billion reclassification from customer deposits previously included in other long-term liabilities.

In the second quarter of 2018, we completed the divestiture of Wind River Systems, Inc. and recognized a pre-tax gain of $494 million. For the first nine months of 2018, we have settled conversion requests for our 2039 convertible debentures totaling $793 million in principal, resulting in a cumulative loss of $211 million.NOTE 7: INCOME TAXES During the third quarter of 2018, we adjusted our provisional tax estimates related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the impact of additional analysis related to the transition tax liability and the refinement of our measurement of deferred income taxes. Our estimated annual effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 includes provisional tax estimates for certain Tax Reform provisions related to foreign-derived intangible income and low-taxed intangible income. Our accounting remains incomplete as of the third quarter of 2018. We could receive additional data and regulatory guidance during the fourth quarter of 2018 that may impact our provisional estimates.Our effective income tax rate was 10.3% in the first nine months of 2018 compared to 28.1% in the first nine months of 2017. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2018 by approximately nine percentage points. Further, the Tax Reform provisions related to foreign-derived intangible income favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately four percentage points, and the provision related to low-taxed intangible income and the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction each unfavorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately one percentage point. The decrease in the first nine months of 2018 was also driven by non-recurring items, primarily our divestiture of ISecG in the second quarter of 2017, which increased our effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2017 by approximately five percentage points, and the adjustment to our provisional estimates for Tax Reform in the first nine months of 2018, which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements14Table of ContentsNOTE 8: INVESTMENTS DEBT INVESTMENTSTrading AssetsTrading assets still held at the reporting date incurred net losses of $4 million in the third quarter of 2018 and net losses of $169 million in the first nine months of 2018 (net gains of $81 million in the third quarter of 2017 and net gains of $433 million in the first nine months of 2017).

On April 28, 2017, Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera) completed its initial public offering and we designated our previous equity and cost method investments in Cloudera as available-for-sale. During the second quarter of 2017, we determined we had an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of our investment and recognized an impairment charge of $278 million. Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel® architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones. We agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd., a holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup. During 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment and accounted for our interest using the cost method of accounting. During 2017, we reduced our expectation of the company's future operating performance due to competitive pressures, which resulted in an impairment charge of $308 million.IM Flash Technologies, LLCIntel-Micron Flash Technologies (IMFT) was formed in 2006 by Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) and Intel to jointly develop NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint™ technology products. IMFT is an unconsolidated variable interest entity and all costs of IMFT are passed on to Micron and Intel through sale of products or services in proportional share of ownership. As of September 29, 2018, we own a 49% interest in IMFT. Our portion of IMFT costs was approximately $97 million in the third quarter of 2018 and approximately $324 million in the first nine months of 2018 (approximately $115 million in the third quarter of 2017 and approximately $350 million in the first nine months of 2017).IMFT depends on Micron and Intel for any additional cash needs to be provided in the form of cash calls or member debt financing (MDF). The MDF balance may be converted to a capital contribution at our request, or may be repaid upon availability of funds. The IMFT operating agreement continues through 2024 unless terminated earlier, and provides for certain buy-sell rights of the joint venture. Intel has the right to cause Micron to buy our interest in IMFT and, if exercised, Micron could elect to receive financing from us for one to two years. Commencing in January 2019, Micron has the right to call our interest in IMFT.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements16Table of ContentsOn July 16, 2018, Intel and Micron announced that they agreed to complete joint development for the second generation of 3D XPoint technology, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2019. Technology development beyond the second generation of 3D XPoint technology will be pursued independently by the two companies in order to optimize the technology for their respective product and business needs. Intel continues to purchase jointly developed products from Micron under certain supply agreements. On October 18, 2018, Micron publicly announced their intent to exercise the right to call our interest in IMFT. The timeline to close the transaction is between six and twelve months after the date Micron exercises the call. Following the closing date, we will continue to receive supply for a period of one year. We recognized an impairment charge of $290 million during the third quarter of 2018. This reduced the carrying value of our equity method investment in IMFT to $1.6 billion in line with our expectation of future cash flows and Micron exercising the call in January.NOTE 9: IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS   September 29, 2018(In Millions) Gross Assets AccumulatedAmortization NetAcquisition-related developed technology $9,611 $(2,742) $6,869Acquisition-related customer relationships 2,036 (433) 1,603Acquisition-related brands 143 (44) 99Licensed technology and patents 3,052 (1,505) 1,547Identified intangible assets subject to amortization 14,842 (4,724) 10,118In-process research and development 1,497 — 1,497Other intangible assets 392 — 392Identified intangible assets not subject to amortization 1,889 — 1,889Total identified intangible assets $16,731 $(4,724) $12,007  December 30, 2017(In Millions) Gross Assets AccumulatedAmortization NetAcquisition-related developed technology $8,912 $(1,922) $6,990Acquisition-related customer relationships 2,052 (313) 1,739Acquisition-related brands 143 (29) 114Licensed technology and patents 3,104 (1,370) 1,734Identified intangible assets subject to amortization 14,211 (3,634) 10,577In-process research and development 2,168 — 2,168Identified intangible assets not subject to amortization 2,168 — 2,168Total identified intangible assets $16,379 $(3,634) $12,745Amortization expenses recorded in the consolidated condensed statements of income for each period were as follows:    Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended(In Millions) Location Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017 Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017Acquisition-related developed technology Cost of sales $276 $243 $826 $650Acquisition-related customer relationships Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 45 45 135 113Acquisition-related brands Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 5 4 15 11Licensed technology and patents Cost of sales 64 73 196 225Total amortization expenses   $390 $365 $1,172 $999FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements17Table of ContentsWe expect future amortization expenses for the next five years to be as follows:(In Millions) Remainder of 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022Acquisition-related developed technology $279 $1,114 $1,082 $1,047 $1,008Acquisition-related customer relationships 45 180 179 179 171Acquisition-related brands 5 20 20 20 6Licensed technology and patents 64 241 210 198 193Total future amortization expenses $393 $1,555 $1,491 $1,444 $1,378NOTE 10: OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS (In Millions) Sep 29, 2018 Dec 30, 2017Non-current deferred tax assets $1,011 $840Pre-payments for property, plant and equipment 1,383 714Loans receivable 544 860Other 1,017 801Total other long-term assets $3,955 $3,215NOTE 11: BORROWINGSFor the first nine months of 2018, we paid $1.9 billion to satisfy conversion obligations for $793 million of our $2.0 billion 3.25% junior subordinated 2039 convertible debentures.

The bonds mature between 2035 and 2040 and carry interest rates of 2.4% - 2.7%. Each series of the Arizona bonds and the Oregon bonds are subject to mandatory tender in August 2023, at which time we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until another fixed rate period is selected or until their final maturity date.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements18Table of ContentsNOTE 12: FAIR VALUE For information about our fair value policies, and methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, see "Note 2: Accounting Policies" and "Note 15: Fair Value" in our 2017 Form 10-K.ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS  September 29, 2018 December 30, 2017  Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using  Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using (In Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets                Cash equivalents:                Corporate debt $— $179 $— $179 $— $30 $— $30Financial institution instruments 1 478 318 — 796 335 640 — 975Government debt 2 — — — — — 90 — 90Reverse repurchase agreements — 1,949 — 1,949 — 1,399 — 1,399Short-term investments:                Corporate debt — 573 — 573 — 672 3 675Financial institution instruments 1 — 1,740 — 1,740 — 1,009 — 1,009Government debt 2 — 328 — 328 — 130 — 130Trading assets:                Asset-backed securities — — — — — 2 — 2Corporate debt — 2,562 — 2,562 — 2,842 — 2,842Financial institution instruments 1 29 1,299 — 1,328 59 1,064 — 1,123Government debt 2 28 3,220 — 3,248 30 4,758 — 4,788Other current assets:                Derivative assets — 150 — 150 — 279 — 279Loans receivable 3 — 304 — 304 — 30 — 30Marketable equity securities 3,039 — — 3,039 4,148 44 — 4,192Other long-term investments:                Corporate debt — 1,868 — 1,868 — 1,576 4 1,580Financial institution instruments 1 — 1,096 — 1,096 — 1,397 — 1,397Government debt 2 — 598 — 598 — 735 — 735Other long-term assets:                Derivative assets — 47 — 47 — 77 7 84Loans receivable 3 — 294 — 294 — 610 — 610Total assets measured and recorded at fair value 3,574 16,525 — 20,099 4,572 17,384 14 21,970Liabilities                Other accrued liabilities:                Derivative liabilities — 464 — 464 — 454 — 454Other long-term liabilities:                Derivative liabilities — 761 106 867 — 297 6 303Total liabilities measured and recorded at fair value $— $1,225 $106 $1,331 $— $751 $6 $7571 Level 1 investments consist of money market funds.

If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASISFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities (that have not been re-measured or impaired in the current period), equity method investments, grants receivable, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements and our short-term and long-term debt.Prior to the adoption of the new financial instrument standard, our non-marketable cost method investments were disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis and the carrying amount and fair value as of December 30, 2017 was $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. These assets were classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs. As of September 29, 2018, the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable, loans receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements was $1.1 billion (the aggregate carrying amount as of December 30, 2017 was $935 million). The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value and is categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.As of September 29, 2018, the fair value of short and long-term debt (excluding drafts payable) was $29.3 billion (the fair value as of December 30, 2017 was $29.4 billion). These liabilities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.

Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.European Commission Competition MatterIn 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged "conditional rebates and payments" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged "payments to prevent sales of specific rival products." The EC imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to "immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in" the EC decision.The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should "cease and desist" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements25Table of ContentsWe appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intel's grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court has appointed a panel of five judges to consider our appeal of the EC's 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice's clarifications of the law. In November 2017, the parties filed initial “Observations” about the Court of Justice's decision and the appeal, and were invited by the General Court to offer supplemental comments to each other's “Observations,” which the parties submitted in March 2018. Responses to other questions posed by the General Court were filed in May and June 2018. We are now awaiting notice whether the General Court will hold a management conference before it conducts oral argument, at some future date. Pending the final decision in this matter, the fine paid by Intel has been placed by the EC in commercial bank accounts where it accrues interest.Shareholder Derivative Litigation regarding In re High Tech Employee Antitrust LitigationIn March 2014, the Police Retirement System of St. Louis (PRSSL) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and former officers. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duties to the company by participating in, or allowing, purported antitrust violations that were alleged in a now-settled antitrust class action lawsuit captioned In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation claiming that Intel, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Google Inc., Intuit Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd., and Pixar conspired to suppress their employees' compensation. In March 2014, a second plaintiff, Barbara Templeton, filed a substantially similar derivative suit in the same court. In May 2014, a third shareholder, Robert Achermann, filed a substantially similar derivative action in the same court. The court consolidated the three actions into one, which is captioned In re Intel Corporation Shareholder Derivative Litigation. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in July 2014. In August 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion for new trial, both of which the court denied in October 2015. In November 2015, plaintiffs PRSSL and Templeton appealed the court's decision. The appeal was withdrawn in September 2018, and the case is over.In June 2015, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Chancery Court in Delaware against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and former officers. The lawsuit makes allegations substantially similar to those in the California shareholder derivative litigation described above, but additionally alleges breach of the duty of disclosure with respect to In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation and that Intel's 2013 and 2014 proxy statements misrepresented the effectiveness of the Board's oversight of compliance issues at Intel and the Board's compliance with Intel's Code of Conduct and Board of Director Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues. In October 2015, the court stayed the IBEW lawsuit for six months pending further developments in the California case. In March 2016, Intel and IBEW entered into a stipulated dismissal pursuant to which IBEW dismissed its complaint without prejudice.McAfee, Inc. Shareholder LitigationOn August 19, 2010, we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of the common stock of McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) for $48.00 per share. Four McAfee shareholders filed putative class-action lawsuits in Santa Clara County, California Superior Court challenging the proposed transaction. The cases were ordered consolidated in September 2010. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named former McAfee board members, McAfee, and Intel as defendants, and alleged that the McAfee board members breached their fiduciary duties and that McAfee and Intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty. The complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement, such other equitable relief as the court may deem proper, and an award of damages in an unspecified amount. In June 2012, the plaintiffs' damages expert asserted that the value of a McAfee share for the purposes of assessing damages should be $62.08.In January 2012, the court certified the action as a class action, appointed the Central Pension Laborers' Fund to act as the class representative, and scheduled trial to begin in January 2013. In March 2012, defendants filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order; the petition was denied in June 2012. In March 2012, at defendants' request, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial and ordered a bench trial. In April 2012, plaintiffs filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order, which the court of appeal denied in July 2012. In August 2012, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted that motion in November 2012, and entered final judgment in the case in February 2013. In April 2013, plaintiffs appealed the final judgment. The California Court of Appeal heard oral argument in October 2017, and in November 2017, affirmed the judgment as to McAfee's nine outside directors, reversed the judgment as to former McAfee director and chief executive officer David DeWalt, Intel, and McAfee, and affirmed the trial court's ruling that the plaintiffs are not entitled to a jury trial. At a June 2018 case management conference following remand, the Superior Court set an October hearing date for any additional summary judgment motions that may be filed, and set trial to begin in December 2018. In July 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint which the court denied in September 2018. Also in July 2018, McAfee and Intel filed a motion for summary judgment on the aiding and abetting claims asserted against them; in October 2018, the court granted the motion as to McAfee and denied the motion as to Intel. Because the resolution of pretrial motions may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, and because of uncertainties regarding the disposition of theories that may be asserted at trial and the extent of Intel's responsibility, if any, with respect to such claims, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements26Table of ContentsLitigation related to Security VulnerabilitiesIn June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown”) that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our executives and directors, in U.S. federal and state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, as well as another variant of these vulnerabilities (“Foreshadow”) that has since been identified.As of October 24, 2018, 47 consumer class action lawsuits and three securities class action lawsuits have been filed. The consumer class action plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of end users of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. Of the consumer class action lawsuits, 43 have been filed in the United States, two in Canada, and two in Israel. In April 2018, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the U.S. consumer class action lawsuits consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. Intel filed a motion to dismiss that consolidated action in October 2018, and a hearing on that motion has been scheduled for February 2019. There has been no activity in the case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and in October 2018 the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec entered an order staying the case pending in that court for one year. In Israel, both consumer class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court of Haifa. The Supreme Court of Israel stayed the first case pending disposition of an appeal by one of Intel's co-defendants of an order by the District Court of Haifa. Intel filed a motion to stay the second case, which is scheduled for hearing in November 2018. In the securities class action litigation, the lead securities class action plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 27, 2017 and January 9, 2018, generally allege that Intel and certain officers violated securities laws by making statements about Intel's products that were revealed to be false or misleading by the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities. The securities class actions have been consolidated and are pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Defendants moved to dismiss those actions on various grounds, and a hearing on that motion has been scheduled for November 2018. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted on behalf of customers and shareholders seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.In addition to these lawsuits, Intel stockholders have filed seven shareholder derivative lawsuits since January 2018 against certain current and former members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former officers, alleging that the defendants breached their duties to Intel in connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. The complaints seek to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. Three of the derivative actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and have been consolidated, and the other four were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California in San Mateo County and have been consolidated. In August 2018, the federal court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on the ground that plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to show they were excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. The federal court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, but in September 2018, plaintiffs instead requested that the action be voluntarily dismissed. Defendants and plaintiffs disagree whether the dismissal should be with or without prejudice, and are awaiting the court's decision on that issue. In August 2018, the California Superior Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint in the action on the ground that plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to show they were excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. The state court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, and the parties have stipulated that plaintiffs must file any amended complaint by February 2019. The state court plaintiffs have also moved to intervene in the federal action to argue against the dismissal of the federal case with prejudice; defendants are opposing that motion.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements27Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) - RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe third quarter was a record quarter in revenue, operating income, and net income, driven by strong customer demand for the performance of our leadership products across the business. Data Center Group (DCG), Client Computing Group (CCG), Internet of Things Group (IOTG), Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG), and Mobileye each achieved record revenue. Strong business performance, operating margin leverage, and lower tax rate resulted in net income of $6.4 billion in the third quarter. From a capital allocation perspective, in the first nine months we generated $22.5 billion of cash flow from operations and returned $12.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends and $8.5 billion in buybacks.

GROSS MARGIN(Dollars in chart are shown in billions; percentages indicate gross margin as a percentage of total revenue) GROSS MARGIN    We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars from the sale of platform products in the CCG and DCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in Q3 2018 increased by $2.3 billion compared to Q3 2017. In the first nine months of 2018, our gross margin percentage was slightly up as the gross margin increase from platform products was substantially offset by the growth from lower margin adjacent businesses, which negatively impacted our gross margin percentage but favorably impacted gross margin dollars.MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Results & Analysis29Table of Contents(In Millions) Gross Margin Walk$12,360 Q3 2018 Gross Margin2,100 Higher gross margin from platform revenue315 Higher gross margin from adjacent businesses primarily from memory and modem305 Higher margin primarily from sell-through of previously reserved and non-qualified platform products(390) Higher platform unit costs, primarily from increased mix to performance products(34) Other$10,064 Q3 2017 Gross Margin   $32,510 YTD 2018 Gross Margin4,800 Higher gross margin from platform revenue230 Higher margin primarily from sell-through of previously reserved and non-qualified platform products(835) Higher platform unit cost primarily from increased mix to performance products(5) Other$28,320 YTD 2017 Gross MarginMD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Results & Analysis30Table of ContentsOPERATING EXPENSES(Dollars in charts are shown in billions; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of total revenue) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVETotal research and development (R&D) and marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) expenses for Q3 2018 were $5.0 billion, up 3% from Q3 2017, and were $15.3 billion for YTD 2018, flat from YTD 2017.

The decrease was primarily driven by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), which reduced the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%.Our effective income tax rate was 10.3% in the first nine months of 2018 compared to 28.1% in the first nine months of 2017. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2018 by approximately nine percentage points. Further, the Tax Reform provisions related to foreign-derived intangible income favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately four percentage points, and the provision related to low-taxed intangible income and the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction each unfavorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately one percentage point. The decrease in the first nine months of 2018 was also driven by non-recurring items, primarily our divestiture of ISecG in the second quarter of 2017 which increased our effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2017 by approximately five percentage points and the adjustment to our provisional estimates for Tax Reform in the first nine months of 2018 which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points.MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Segment Results & Analysis37Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:(Dollars in Millions) Sep 29, 2018 Dec 30, 2017Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets $13,186 $14,002Other long-term investments $3,562 $3,712Loans receivable and other $1,404 $1,097Reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months $250 $250Total debt $27,874 $26,813Temporary equity $515 $866Debt as percentage of permanent stockholders' equity 39.0% 38.8%Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity.

MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Results & Analysis38Table of ContentsInvesting ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.Cash used for investing activities was lower for the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to lower cash paid on acquisitions. This was partially offset by increased capital expenditures and decreased proceeds from divestitures, decreased sales of equity investments (substantially all from ASML sales), and increased net purchases of available-for-sale debt investments. Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.Cash used for financing activities was higher in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to decreased long-term debt issuance and increased repurchases of common stock. The cash used for financing activities was partially offset by increases in commercial paper.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. For discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within "MD&A - Results of Operations," in our 2017 Form 10-K.  MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Results & Analysis39Table of ContentsOTHER KEY INFORMATIONRISK FACTORSThe risks described in "Risk Factors" within "Other Key Information" in our 2017 Form 10-K and our Q2 2018 Form 10-Q could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Risk Factors section in our 2017 Form 10-K, as updated by our Q2 2018 Form 10-Q, remains current in all material respects.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 29, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe believe non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. Our non-GAAP operating income and diluted earnings per share reflect adjustments for the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Acquisition-related adjustments The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company exclude certain business combination accounting adjustments and certain expenses related to acquisitions.Inventory valuation adjustments: Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company's cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin. The non-GAAP adjustments to our cost of sales exclude the expected profit margin component that is recorded under business combination accounting principles associated with our acquisition of Mobileye. We believe the adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect cost of sales and gross margin trends of our business. OTHER KEY INFORMATION 40Table of ContentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. We record charges related to the amortization of these intangibles within both cost of sales and operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.Other acquisition-related charges: Other acquisition-related charges exclude the impact of other charges associated with the acquisition of Mobileye. These charges primarily include bankers' fees, compensation-related costs, and valuation charges for stock-based compensation incurred related to the acquisition. We believe these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect the spending trends of our business. Restructuring and other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include asset impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with the ISecG divestiture. We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these costs do not reflect our current operating performance. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. Ongoing mark to market on marketable equity securitiesWe exclude gains and losses resulting from ongoing mark to market adjustments of our marketable equity securities when calculating certain non-GAAP measures, as we do not believe this volatility correlates to our core operational performance. Consequently, our non-GAAP earnings per share figures exclude these impacts to facilitate an evaluation of our current performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.Tax Reform adjustment During 2018, we made adjustments to our Tax Reform provisional tax estimates that we recorded in Q4 2017. We exclude these provisional tax adjustments when calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe making this adjustment facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Following are the reconciliations of our most comparable GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:  Three Months Ended(In Millions) Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017Operating income $7,349 $5,141Inventory valuation adjustments — 27Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 326 292Other acquisition-related charges — 113Restructuring and other charges (72) 4Non-GAAP Operating income $7,603 $5,577  Three Months Ended  Sep 29, 2018 Sep 30, 2017Earnings per share - Diluted $1.38 $0.94Inventory valuation adjustments — 0.01Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 0.07 0.06Restructuring and other charges (0.02) —Other acquisition-related charges — 0.02Ongoing mark to market on marketable equity securities — —Tax Reform (0.02) —Income tax effect (0.01) (0.02)Non-GAAP Earnings per share - Diluted $1.40 $1.01OTHER KEY INFORMATION 41Table of ContentsISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESWe have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions.

In our consolidated condensed financial statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan and accordingly are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the preceding table.OTHER KEY INFORMATION 42Table of ContentsEXHIBITS    Incorporated by Reference  ExhibitNumber Exhibit Description Form File Number Exhibit FilingDate Filed orFurnishedHerewith3.1 Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Intel Corporation dated May 17, 2006 8-K 000-06217 3.1 5/22/2006  3.2 Intel Corporation Bylaws, as amended and restated on March 14, 2018 8-K 000-06217 3.2 3/19/2018  10.1† Intel Corporation Form of Notice of Grant - Restricted Stock Units         X10.2† Intel Corporation Restricted Stock Unit Agreement under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (for time-based RSUs granted to Robert Swan as interim CEO on August 15, 2018)         X10.3† Intel Corporation Restricted Stock Unit Agreement under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (for performance-based RSUs granted to Robert Swan as interim CEO on August 15, 2018)         X12.1 Statement Setting Forth the Computation of Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges         X31.1 Certification of interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)         X32.1 Certification of the interim Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(b) of the Exchange Act and 18 U.S.C.
