Consolidation and Basis of Presentation. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These financial statements present the condensed consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 (the “2017 Annual Report”) filed on August 10, 2017 with the SEC. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with GAAP of the Company's financial position at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, the results of its operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and its cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.  In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU No. 2016-09”). Please refer to Note 2, “New Accounting Pronouncements,” for a discussion of the impact of ASU No. 2016-09. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes” (“ASU No. 2015-17”). Please refer to Note 2, “New Accounting Pronouncements,” for a discussion of the impact of ASU No. 2015-17.  C. Use of Estimates. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions and judgment that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. D. Subsequent Events. In preparing the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has reviewed events that have occurred after December 31, 2017 through the date of issuance of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. During this period, the Company did not have any subsequent events for disclosure.NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09. ASU No. 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including presenting the excess tax benefit or deficit from the exercise or vesting of share-based payments in the income statement, classifying the excess tax benefit or deficit as an operating activity in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows rather than as a financing activity, a revision to the criteria for classifying an award as equity or liability and an option to recognize gross stock-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur. In addition, ASU No. 2016-09 eliminates the excess tax benefit from the assumed proceeds calculation under the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted shares. As a result of this adoption, the Company recorded excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards of $1.5 million and $3.0 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 in the income tax provision on a prospective basis, whereas such benefits were previously recognized in equity. The Company also excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the 8Table of Contentsthree and six months ended December 31, 2017. The Company has not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in accounting for excess tax benefits in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also elected to apply the change in presentation of excess tax benefits in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prospectively, and as a result, excess tax benefits are classified as operating activities when realized through reductions to subsequent tax payments. This adoption resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities of $3.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017. The Company has not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in classification of excess tax benefits on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company also elected to continue its current practice of estimating expected forfeitures as permitted by ASU No. 2016-09. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17 on a prospective basis to all deferred tax liabilities and assets. The amendments in ASU No. 2015-17 require entities that present a classified balance sheet to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as a noncurrent amount. The Company's fiscal year 2017 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet has not been retrospectively adjusted for the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU No. 2017-04”). ASU No. 2017-04 removes Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test, which currently requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation if the fair value of a reporting unit were to be less than its book value, for purposes of determining the amount of goodwill impaired. Under ASU No. 2017-04, the Company would now recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU No. 2017-04 will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, to be applied on a prospective basis. The pending adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Clarifying the Definition of a Business” (“ASU No. 2017-01”).  ASU No. 2017-01 narrows the definition of a business, in part by concluding that an integrated set of assets and activities (referred to as a “set”) is not a business when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. ASU No. 2017-01 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, to be applied on a prospective basis. The pending adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASU No. 2016-02”). Under ASU No. 2016-02, all lease arrangements, with certain limited exceptions, exceeding a twelve-month term must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee by recording a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease obligation generally equal to the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. Further, the income statement will reflect lease expense for leases classified as operating and amortization/interest expense for leases classified as financing, determined using classification criteria substantially similar to the current lease guidance for distinguishing between an operating and capital lease. ASU No. 2016-02 also contains certain additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity's leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and will be adopted on a modified retrospective basis, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU No. 2016-01”), which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. Under ASU No. 2016-01, changes in the fair value of publicly traded equity securities for which the Company does not have significant influence would be recorded as part of Net earnings rather than as Other comprehensive income (loss), net. In addition, equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value will be recorded at cost less impairment as further adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the issuer. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-01 related to changes in fair value of publicly traded equity securities will be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of fiscal year 2019, while the guidance related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values will be adopted prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the beginning of fiscal year 2019. The pending adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU No. 2014-09”), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is 9Table of Contentsto recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU No. 2014-09 also requires certain enhanced disclosures, including disclosures on the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date,” which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year, with an option that would permit companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date. As a result, ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for the Company as of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 for which the Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU No. 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application along with providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU No. 2014-09. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, “Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)” (“ASU No. 2016-08”), which provides clarifying implementation guidance to the principal versus agent provisions of ASU No. 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 “Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing” (“ASU No. 2016-10”), which provides clarifying implementation guidance for applying ASU No. 2014-09 with respect to identifying performance obligations and the accounting for licensing arrangements. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients” (“ASU No. 2016-12”), which provides certain clarifying guidance for ASU No. 2014-09 relative to treatment of sales taxes, noncash consideration, collectibility and certain aspects of transitional guidance. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20 “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which provides certain technical corrections for ASU No. 2014-09 including the impairment testing of capitalized contract costs, disclosure of remaining performance obligations, and certain other matters. Each of ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-12 and ASU No. 2016-20 have the same effective date as ASU No. 2014-09.  While the Company is still in the process of evaluating the full impact of the pending adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and related amendments on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, including assessing the need for process changes or enhancements, the Company has identified certain expected impacts of the new standard on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Specifically, the Company expects to capitalize certain sales commissions, as well as capitalize certain additional costs that are part of setting up or converting a client's systems to function with the Company's technology, both of which are currently expensed. Additionally, the Company expects to recognize proxy revenue predominantly at the time of proxy distribution to the client's shareholders rather than on the date of the client's shareholder meeting, which is typically 30 days after the proxy distribution. Other expected changes to the timing of revenue recognition include deferral of revenue from certain transaction processing platform enhancements as well as acceleration of revenue from certain multi-year software license arrangements that are currently recognized over the term of the software subscription.  While the annual impact of the new revenue guidance to the Company's income statement could vary year to year, the annual income statement impact of the new revenue guidance is estimated to be less than 1% of the Company's fiscal year 2017 revenues and approximately 2% of the Company's fiscal year 2017 earnings before income taxes. Also, the Company currently estimates the cumulative impact to opening retained earnings of adopting the new revenue guidance will be less than $100 million, driven primarily by an increase in capitalized costs. NOTE 3. EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the Company's Net earnings by the basic Weighted-average shares outstanding for the periods presented. The Company calculates diluted EPS using the treasury stock method, which reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented date are exercised and restricted stock unit awards have vested.The computation of diluted EPS excluded options of 0.1 million to purchase Broadridge common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and options of 0.1 million to purchase Broadridge common stock for the six months ended December 31, 2017, as the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.10Table of ContentsThe computation of diluted EPS excluded options of less than 0.1 million to purchase Broadridge common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and options of less than 0.1 million to purchase Broadridge common stock for the six months ended December 31, 2016, as the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.The following table sets forth the denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations (in millions): Three Months Ended  December 31, Six Months Ended  December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016Weighted-average shares outstanding:       Basic116.6 118.7 116.5 118.6Common stock equivalents3.8 2.8 3.5 3.0Diluted (1)120.3 121.5 120.1 121.5(1) On July 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09.

ACQUISITIONSBUSINESS COMBINATIONSAssets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition date based upon the estimated fair values at such date. The results of operations of the business acquired by the Company are included in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings since the respective date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to Goodwill. Certain of our acquisitions may contain contingent consideration liabilities based upon the achievement of certain individually defined financial targets of the acquired business. These contingent consideration liabilities are measured at fair value based upon management's expectations of future achievement by the acquired business of these individual financial targets.11Table of ContentsDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company acquired one business in the Investor Communication Solutions segment:SummitIn October 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Summit, a full service financial document management solutions provider, including document composition and regulatory filing services. The aggregate purchase price was $30.6 million in cash, consisting of $26.4 million in cash payments net of cash acquired, a $1.4 million note payable to the sellers that will be settled in the future, and a contingent consideration liability with an acquisition date fair value of $2.7 million. The contingent consideration liability is payable over the next three years upon the achievement by the acquired business of certain revenue and earnings targets. The contingent consideration liability has a maximum potential pay-out of $11.0 million upon the achievement in full of the defined financial targets by the acquired business. Net tangible assets acquired in the transaction were $0.6 million. This acquisition resulted in $18.1 million of Goodwill, which is primarily tax deductible. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $12.0 million, consist primarily of software technology and customer relationships, which are being amortized over a five-year life and seven-year life, respectively. The allocation of the purchase price will be finalized upon completion of the analysis of the fair values of the acquired business' assets and liabilities, which is still subject to a working capital adjustment.ASSET ACQUISITIONS   Purchase of Intellectual PropertyIn September 2016, the Company's Investor Communication Solutions segment acquired intellectual property assets from Inveshare, Inc. (“Inveshare”) and concurrently entered into a development agreement with an affiliate of Inveshare to use these assets to develop blockchain technology applications for Broadridge's proxy business. The purchase price was $95.0 million, which consisted of a $90.0 million cash payment upon closing of the acquisition and a $5.0 million obligation which the Company paid during the three months ended September 30, 2017.The Company also expects to pay a deferred payment of $40.0 million to an affiliate of Inveshare upon delivery of the new blockchain technology applications in February 2018.NOTE 7. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSAccounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:Level 1Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 2Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculates the fair value of its Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.The Company holds available-for-sale securities issued by a non-public entity for which the lowest level of significant inputs is unobservable. On a recurring basis, the Company uses pricing models and similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment by management. Accordingly, the Company classifies the available-for-sale securities as Level 3 in the table below.The fair values of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this 12Table of Contentsliability as Level 3 in the table below.The following tables set forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively, that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions)Assets:       Cash and cash equivalents:       Money market funds (1)$158.6 $— $— $158.6Other current assets:       Available-for-sale securities0.1 — — 0.1Other non-current assets:       Available-for-sale securities63.1 — 1.1 64.2Total assets as of December 31, 2017$221.9 $— $1.1 $223.0Liabilities:       Contingent consideration obligations:— — 11.3 11.3Total liabilities as of December 31, 2017$— $— $11.3 $11.3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions)Assets:       Cash and cash equivalents:       Money market funds (1)$37.9 $— $— $37.9Other current assets:       Available-for-sale securities0.1 — — 0.1Other non-current assets:       Available-for-sale securities50.6 — 1.1 51.7Total assets as of June 30, 2017$88.6 $— $1.1 $89.8Liabilities:       Contingent consideration obligations:— — 6.7 6.7Total liabilities as of June 30, 2017$— $— $6.7 $6.7_____________(1)Money market funds include money market deposit account balances of $100.0 million and less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively.The following table sets forth an analysis of changes during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, in Level 3 financial liabilities of the Company: December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in millions)Beginning balance$6.7 $5.5Additional contingent consideration incurred4.5 0.9Increase in contingent consideration liability— (0.4)Foreign currency impact on contingent consideration liability0.2 (0.2)Payments— —Ending balance$11.3 $5.913Table of ContentsThe Company did not incur any Level 3 fair value asset impairments during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Changes in economic conditions or model based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments between levels. The Company's policy is to record transfers between levels if any, as of the beginning of the fiscal year. NOTE 8.

The Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility is comprised of a $900.0 million U.S. dollar tranche and a $100.0 million multicurrency tranche. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $330.0 million in outstanding borrowings and had unused available capacity of $670.0 million under the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility.The weighted-average interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facilities was 2.25% and 2.23% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and 1.52% and 1.51% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The fair value of the variable-rate Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility borrowings at December 31, 2017 approximates carrying value and has been classified as a Level 2 financial liability (as defined in Note 7, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments”).Borrowings under the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility can be made in tranches up to 360 days and bear interest at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. In addition, the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility has an annual facility fee equal to 12.5 basis points on the entire facility, similar to the previous Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. The annual facility fees for the Revolving Credit Facilities totaled $0.3 million and $0.6 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The Company incurred $1.8 million in costs to establish the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2017, $2.4 million of these costs remain to be amortized (including $0.2 million and $0.7 million of issuance costs from the Fiscal 2012 Revolving Credit Facility and Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively). Such costs are capitalized in Other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized to Interest expense, net on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of this facility.The Company may voluntarily prepay, in whole or in part and without premium or penalty, borrowings under the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility in accordance with individual drawn loan maturities. The Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain covenants, including a leverage ratio. At December 31, 2017, the Company is in compliance with all covenants of the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility.Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes: In August 2013, the Company completed an offering of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the “Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes”). The Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes will mature on September 1, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 3.95% per annum. Interest on the Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1st and September 1st each year. The Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes were issued at a price of 99.871% (effective yield to maturity of 3.971%). The indenture governing the Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes contains certain covenants including covenants restricting the Company's ability to create or incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money and to enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions. At December 31, 2017, the Company is in compliance with the covenants of the indenture 15Table of Contentsgoverning the Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes. The indenture also contains covenants regarding the purchase of the Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event. The Company may redeem the Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time before their maturity. The Company incurred $4.3 million in debt issuance costs to establish the Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes. These costs have been capitalized and are being amortized to Interest expense, net on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the seven-year term. As of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, $1.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs remain to be amortized and have been presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes. The fair value of the fixed-rate Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 was $414.2 million and $419.1 million, respectively, based on quoted market prices and has been classified as a Level 1 financial liability (as defined in Note 7, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments”).Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes: In June 2016, the Company completed an offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the “Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes”). The Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes will mature on June 27, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 3.40% per annum. Interest on the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 27 and December 27 of each year. The Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes were issued at a price of 99.589% (effective yield to maturity of 3.449%). The indenture governing the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes contains certain covenants including covenants restricting the Company's ability to create or incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, to enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions, and to engage in mergers or consolidations and transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets. At December 31, 2017, the Company is in compliance with the covenants of the indenture governing the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes. The indenture also contains covenants regarding the purchase of the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event. The Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with the Company's other senior indebtedness. The Company may redeem the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time before their maturity. The Company incurred $4.5 million in debt issuance costs to establish the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes. These costs have been capitalized and are being amortized to Interest expense, net on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the ten-year term. As of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, $3.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs remain to be amortized and have been presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes. The fair value of the fixed-rate Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 was $496.1 million and $494.6 million, respectively, based on quoted market prices and has been classified as a Level 1 financial liability (as defined in Note 7, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments”).The Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility, Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes, and Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are ranked equally in right of payment.In addition, certain of the Company's subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. As of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit.NOTE 11.

The Company has stock-based compensation plans under which the Company annually grants stock option and restricted stock unit awards. Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the dates of grant, with the measurement of stock-based compensation expense recognized in Net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense of $16.2 million and $14.0 million, as well as related tax benefits of $4.4 million and $4.9 million were recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense of $24.7 million and $22.8 million, as well as related tax benefits of $7.3 million and $8.1 million were recognized for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.As of December 31, 2017, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock unit awards amounted to $5.6 million and $63.5 million, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of 2.1 years and 1.8 years, respectively.For stock options issued, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Company's stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.NOTE 12. INCOME TAXESThe provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 was $41.4 million and $65.8 million compared to $15.6 million and $33.4 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 was 40.0% and 37.0% compared to 34.1% and 34.4% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and six 17Table of Contentsmonths ended December 31, 2017, compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.One of the primary provisions in the Tax Act is a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. With a fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the Company's federal corporate statutory income tax rate will be subject to a full year blended tax rate of 28.1%. Beginning July 1, 2018, the Company will be subject to a U.S. federal corporate statutory income tax rate of 21.0%.In addition, the Tax Act requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017. The Company has estimated this tax obligation to be $11.4 million and is payable over an eight-year period. In connection with this U.S. federal transition tax on repatriated foreign earnings, the Company has also accrued $20.8 million of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for U.S. tax purposes. Partially offsetting the $32.2 million of aggregate expense related to foreign earnings is a $16.1 million benefit related to the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities. These amounts are provisional and represent the Company's best estimates of the expected impacts of the Tax Act. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from the Company's estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, as well as the amount of our fiscal year 2018 earnings before income taxes.NOTE 13. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSData Center AgreementsIn March 2010, the Company and IBM entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM provides certain aspects of the Company's information technology infrastructure. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provides a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, open systems, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The migration of data center processing to IBM was completed in August 2012. The IT Services Agreement would have expired on June 30, 2022. In March 2015, the Company signed a two-year extension to the IT Services Agreement which expires on June 30, 2024. The Company has the right to renew the term of the IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term. Commitments remaining under this agreement at December 31, 2017 are $361.8 million through fiscal year 2024, the final year of the contract. In March 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited (“IBM UK”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “EU IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company's technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia. The EU IT Services Agreement expires in October 2023. The Company has the right to renew the initial term of the EU IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term or one additional 24-month term. Commitments remaining under this agreement at December 31, 2017 are $29.0 million through fiscal year 2024, the final year of the contract. Equity Method InvestmentThe Company contributed $2.8 million to an equity method investment during the six months ended December 31, 2017, and has a remaining commitment of $2.5 million to fund this investment at December 31, 2017.Purchase of Intellectual Property As discussed in Note 6, “Acquisitions,” the Company expects to pay $40.0 million to an affiliate of Inveshare in February 2018 upon delivery of certain new blockchain technology applications. OtherIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any claim or litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.18Table of ContentsIt is not the Company's business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2017 or at June 30, 2017.In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company's products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.Our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by Broadridge Business Process Outsourcing, LLC (“BBPO”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, which is a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

INTERIM FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENTThe Company operates in two reportable segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations. See Note 1, “Basis of Presentation” for a further description of the Company's reportable segments.The primary components of “Other” are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting.Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.In connection with an organizational change made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services, certain discrete services that were previously reported in our Investor Communication Solutions reportable segment are now reported within the Global Technology and Operations reportable segment.  As a result, our prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this change in reporting segments.20Table of ContentsSegment results:RevenuesThree Months Ended  December 31, Six Months Ended  December 31,20172016 2017 2016(in millions)Investor Communication Solutions$802.2$704.4 $1,528.6 $1,422.4Global Technology and Operations228.0207.0 442.9 400.2Foreign currency exchange(17.4)(18.8) (33.9) (34.6)Total$1,012.8$892.6 $1,937.6 $1,787.9Earnings (Loss) before IncomeTaxesThree Months Ended  December 31, Six Months Ended  December 31,20172016 2017 2016(in millions)Investor Communication Solutions$72.4$20.4 $118.0 $55.1Global Technology and Operations50.644.2 95.7 80.6Other(26.5)(20.8) (48.0) (43.6)Foreign currency exchange7.02.0 12.1 5.2Total$103.5$45.7 $177.8 $97.221Table of ContentsItem 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto included elsewhere herein.Forward-Looking StatementsThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements present the condensed consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding.  The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 10, 2017.In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (”FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”. Please refer to Note 2, “New Accounting Pronouncements” to our Financial Statements under Item 1. of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements. Effective the beginning of fiscal year 2018, the Company adopted ASU No 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.” Please refer to Note 2, “New Accounting Pronouncements” to our Financial Statements under Item 1. of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements.Critical Accounting PoliciesIn presenting the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. In management's opinion, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of Part II, Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Results of OperationsThe following discussions of Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments refer to the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2016. The Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides a more detailed discussion concerning certain components of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.24Table of ContentsThe following references are utilized in the discussions of Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments:“Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property” and “Acquisition and Integration Costs” represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company's acquisition activities, respectively.“Tax Act items” represent a U.S. federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for U.S. tax purposes, and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the recording of the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.     “Net New Business” refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses.The following definitions describe the Company's Revenues:Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:•Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds.•Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters.•Proxy Contests and Specials, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers.Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast.Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 489% higher compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 19% higher and 22% higher than the prior fiscal year, respectively. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future.Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services, as well as Matrix administrative services.Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions segment, as well as Matrix administrative services expenses. These costs are reflected in Cost of revenues.Closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by Broadridge in the current reporting period. Closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. We consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. Management uses Closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation. 25Table of ContentsClosed sales is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance.The inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved Closed sales. Larger Closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our Global Technology and Operations segment. Beginning in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we reported Closed sales net of a 3.5% allowance adjustment, in lieu of our previous practice of adjusting for actual performance in subsequent periods. For fiscal year 2018, we are reporting Closed sales net of a 4.0% allowance adjustment. Consequently, our reported Closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. The allowance adjustment was determined by reviewing the reported Closed sales amounts for the prior five fiscal years based on estimated revenues at signing and comparing those amounts to the revenues achieved one year after the clients went live on the services. We assess this allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using the trailing five years data referenced earlier as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance.Closed SalesClosed sales for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $38.7 million, a decrease of $16.9 million, or 31%, compared to $55.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Closed sales for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is net of an allowance adjustment of $1.6 million. Closed sales for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $61.6 million, a decrease of $15.7 million, or 20%, compared to $77.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Closed sales for the six months ended December 31, 2017 is net of an allowance adjustment of $2.6 million.Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of EarningsThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 versus Three Months Ended December 31, 2016The table below presents Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings data for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Three Months Ended  December 31,      Change  2017 2016 $ %  (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues$1,012.8 $892.6 $120.2 13  Cost of revenues769.8 707.8 62.0 9  Selling, general and administrative expenses127.9 126.0 1.9 2 Total operating expenses897.7 833.8 63.9 8          Operating income115.1 58.8 56.2 96 Margin11.4% 6.6%    Interest expense, net10.2 10.6 (0.5) (4) Other non-operating expenses, net1.4 2.5 (1.1) (44) Earnings before income taxes103.5 45.7 57.8 126 Provision for income taxes41.4 15.6 25.8 165 Effective tax rate40.0% 34.1%    Net earnings$62.1 $30.1 $32.0 106 Basic earnings per share$0.53 $0.25 $0.28 112 Diluted earnings per share$0.52 $0.25 $0.27 108 26Table of ContentsThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 versus Three Months Ended December 31, 2016Revenues. Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,012.8 million, an increase of $120.2 million, or 13%, compared to $892.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The $120.2 million increase was driven by higher event-driven fee revenues of $67.6 million, or 227%, higher recurring fee revenues of $26.3 million, or 5%, and higher distribution revenues of $24.9 million, or 7%. The higher recurring fee revenues of $26.3 million reflected: gains from Net New Business (3pts), contributions from our recent acquisitions (1pt) and internal growth (1pt). The higher event-driven fee revenues were primarily from increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenues by $1.4 million. Total Operating expenses. Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $897.7 million, an increase of $63.9 million, or 8%, compared to $833.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenues increased by $62.0 million, or 9%, and Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.9 million, or 2%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher distribution cost of revenues of $21.0 million driven by the increase in distribution revenues, higher operating costs related to acquisitions of $10.1 million, and higher variable expenses driven in part by the increase in event-driven and recurring fee revenues. Operating income. Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $115.1 million, an increase of $56.2 million, or 96%, compared to $58.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase is due to higher event-driven fee revenues and recurring fee revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses as discussed above. Operating income margins increased to 11.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 6.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the increase in event-driven fee revenues and recurring fee revenues.Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $10.2 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 4%, compared to $10.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of $0.2 million due to a more favorable mix of interest rates on outstanding borrowings.Other non-operating expenses, net.  Other non-operating expenses, net for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1.4 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 44%, compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower expense of $0.6 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and lower losses related to equity method investments of $0.4 million.Earnings before income taxes. Earnings before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $103.5 million, an increase of $57.8 million, or 126%, compared to $45.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Provision for income taxes. The Provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $41.4 million and 40.0%, compared to $15.6 million and 34.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to the enactment of the Tax Act.  With a fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the Company's federal corporate statutory income tax rate will be subject to a full year blended tax rate of 28.1%. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate statutory income tax rate, the Tax Act requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, which the Company has estimated to be $11.4 million. The Company also accrued $20.8 million of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for U.S. tax purposes. Partially offsetting the $32.2 million of aggregate expense related to foreign earnings is a $16.1 million benefit related to the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities. Beginning July 1, 2018, the Company will be subject to a U.S. federal corporate statutory income tax rate of 21.0%. Net Earnings and Basic and Diluted earnings per share.  Net earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $62.1 million, an increase of $32.0 million, or 106%, compared to $30.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Net earnings is primarily due to the increase in event-driven fee and recurring fee revenues. Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $0.53 and $0.52, respectively, compared to $0.25 and $0.25 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.27Table of ContentsSix Months Ended December 31, 2017 versus Six Months Ended December 31, 2016 The table below presents Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings data for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Six Months Ended  December 31,      Change  2017 2016 $ %  (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues$1,937.6 $1,787.9 $149.7 8  Cost of revenues1,496.4 1,425.7 70.7 5  Selling, general and administrative expenses241.7 237.3 4.3 2 Total operating expenses1,738.1 1,663.1 75.0 5          Operating income199.5 124.9 74.7 60 Margin10.3% 7.0%     Interest expense, net19.6 21.0 (1.4) (7) Other non-operating expenses, net2.1 6.7 (4.5) (69) Earnings before income taxes177.8 97.2 80.6 83 Provision for income taxes65.8 33.4 32.4 97 Effective tax rate37.0% 34.4%     Net earnings$112.0 $63.8 $48.2 76 Basic earnings per share$0.96 $0.54 $0.42 78 Diluted earnings per share$0.93 $0.52 $0.41 79 Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 versus Six Months Ended December 31, 2016 Revenues. Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,937.6 million an increase of $149.7 million, or 8%, compared to $1,787.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The $149.7 million increase was driven by higher event-driven fee revenues of $89.3 million, or 133%, and higher recurring fee revenues of $57.2 million, or 5%. The higher recurring fee revenues of $57.2 million reflected: gains from Net New Business (3pts), contributions from our recent acquisitions (1pt) and internal growth (1pt). The higher event-driven fee revenues were primarily from increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenues by $0.8 million. Total Operating expenses. Total operating expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,738.1 million, an increase of $75.0 million, or 5%, compared to $1,663.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenues increased by $70.7 million, or 5%, and Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.3 million, or 2%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher variable expenses driven in part by the increase in event-driven fee revenues and recurring fee revenues and higher operating costs related to acquisitions of $16.9 million.Operating income. Operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $199.5 million, an increase of $74.7 million, or 60%, compared to $124.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The increase is due to higher event-driven fee and recurring fee revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating income margins increased to 10.3% for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 7.0% for the six months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the increase in event-driven fee revenues and recurring fee revenues.Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $19.6 million, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 7%, compared to $21.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of $0.9 million due to a more favorable mix of interest rates on outstanding borrowings.Other non-operating expenses, net. Other non-operating expenses, net for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $2.1 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 69%, compared to $6.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower expense of $3.2 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and lower losses related to equity method investments of $1.3 million.28Table of ContentsEarnings before income taxes. Earnings before income taxes for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $177.8 million, an increase of $80.6 million, or 83%, compared to $97.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Provision for income taxes. The Provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $65.8 million and 37.0%, compared to $33.4 million and 34.4% for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to the enactment of the Tax Act. With a fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the Company's federal corporate statutory income tax rate will be subject to a full year blended tax rate of 28.1%. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate statutory income tax rate, the Tax Act requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, which the Company has estimated to be $11.4 million. The Company also accrued $20.8 million of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for U.S. tax purposes. Partially offsetting the $32.2 million of aggregate expense related to foreign earnings is a $16.1 million benefit related to the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities. Beginning July 1, 2018, the Company will be subject to a U.S. federal corporate statutory income tax rate of 21.0%. Net Earnings and Basic and Diluted earnings per share. Net earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $112.0 million, an increase of $48.2 million, or 76%, compared to $63.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Net earnings primarily reflects higher event-driven fee revenues and recurring fee revenues.Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $0.96 and $0.93, respectively, compared to $0.54 and $0.52 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.Analysis of Reportable SegmentsThe Company classifies its operations into the following two reportable segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Global Technology and Operations.The primary component of “Other” are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting.Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.In connection with an organizational change made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services, certain discrete services that were previously reported in our Investor Communication Solutions reportable segment are now reported within the Global Technology and Operations reportable segment. As a result, our prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this change in reporting segments.Revenues Three Months Ended  December 31, Six Months Ended  December 31,     Change     Change 2017 2016 $ % 2017 2016 $ % (in millions)Investor Communication Solutions$802.2 $704.4 $97.8 14 $1,528.6 $1,422.4 $106.2 7Global Technology and Operations228.0 207.0 20.9 10 442.9 400.2 42.7 11Foreign currency exchange(17.4) (18.8) 1.4 (7) (33.9) (34.6) 0.8 (2)Total$1,012.8 $892.6 $120.2 13 $1,937.6 $1,787.9 $149.7 829Table of ContentsEarnings Before Income Taxes Three Months Ended  December 31, Six Months Ended  December 31,     Change     Change 2017 2016 $ % 2017 2016 $ % (in millions)Investor Communication Solutions$72.4 $20.4 $52.0 255 $118.0 $55.1 $62.9 114Global Technology and Operations50.6 44.2 6.5 14 95.7 80.6 15.1 19Other(26.5) (20.8) (5.7) 27 (48.0) (43.6) (4.4) 10Foreign currency exchange7.0 2.0 5.0 250 12.1 5.2 7.0 133Total$103.5 $45.7 $57.8 126 $177.8 $97.2 $80.6 83Investor Communication Solutions  Three Months Ended  December 31, Six Months Ended  December 31,     Change     Change 2017 2016 $ % 2017 2016 $ % (in millions)Recurring fee revenues$334.4 $329.1 $5.4 2 $667.4 $652.8 $14.5 2Event-driven fee revenues97.3 29.8 67.6 227 156.6 67.3 89.3 133Distribution revenues370.4 345.6 24.9 7 704.7 702.3 2.4 —Total$802.2 $704.4 $97.8 14 $1,528.6 $1,422.4 $106.2 7Revenues.

The $97.8 million increase was driven by: (i) higher event-driven fee revenues of $67.6 million, or 227%, (ii) an increase in distribution revenues of $24.9 million, or 7% and (iii) higher recurring fee revenues of $5.4 million, or 2%. Higher event-driven fee revenues were the result of increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests. Higher recurring fee revenues were primarily driven by Net New Business from increases in revenues from Closed sales and revenues from acquisitions. Position growth compared to the same period in the prior year, which is a component of internal growth, was 10% for mutual fund and exchange traded funds (“ETF”) interims.Investor Communication Solutions segment's Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,528.6 million, an increase of $106.2 million, or 7%, compared to $1,422.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The $106.2 million increase was driven by: (i) higher event-driven fee revenues of $89.3 million, or 133%, (ii) higher recurring fee revenues of $14.5 million, or 2% and (iii) an increase in distribution revenues of $2.4 million. Higher event-driven fee revenues were the result of increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests.

The earnings increase was primarily due to higher event-driven fee revenues and recurring fee revenues. Pre-tax margins increased by 3.8 percentage points to 7.7% from 3.9%.30Table of ContentsGlobal Technology and OperationsRevenues. Global Technology and Operations segment's Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $228.0 million, an increase of $20.9 million, or 10%, compared to $207.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The 10% increase was attributable to: (i) higher Net New Business from Closed sales (5pts), (ii) internal growth from higher trade and non-trade activity levels (3pts) and (iii) revenue from recent acquisitions (2pts). Global Technology and Operations segment's Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $442.9 million, an increase of $42.7 million, or 11%, compared to $400.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016.

In certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures (“Non-GAAP”). These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, and Free cash flow. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results.The Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company's business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the Company's operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company's Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per ShareThese Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Operating income margin, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, Acquisition and Integration Costs, and Tax Act items. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property represents non-cash expenses associated with the Company's acquisition activities. Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company's acquisition activities. Tax Act items represent a U.S. federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes and certain benefits 31Table of Contentsrelated to the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the Tax Act.     We exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, Acquisition and Integration Costs, and Tax Act items from these measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. Management believes these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.Free Cash FlowIn addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software.                     Set forth below is a reconciliation of such Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures (unaudited): Three Months Ended  December 31, Six Months Ended  December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions)Operating income (GAAP)$115.1 $58.8 $199.5 $124.9Adjustments:       Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property19.7 20.4 39.2 33.1       Acquisition and Integration Costs2.6 5.0 4.7 7.8Adjusted Operating income (Non-GAAP)$137.5 $84.2 $243.4 $165.8 Three Months Ended  December 31, Six Months Ended  December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions)Net earnings (GAAP)$62.1 $30.1 $112.0 $63.8Adjustments:       Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property19.7 20.4 39.2 33.1Acquisition and Integration Costs2.6 5.0 4.7 7.8     Taxable adjustments22.4 25.3 43.8 40.9Tax Act items16.1 — 16.1 —Tax impact of adjustments (a)(5.9) (8.7) (13.0) (14.1)Adjusted Net earnings (Non-GAAP)$94.7 $46.8 $158.9 $90.732Table of Contents Three Months Ended  December 31, Six Months Ended  December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016Diluted earnings per share (GAAP)$0.52 $0.25 $0.93 $0.52Adjustments:       Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property0.16 0.17 0.33 0.27Acquisition and Integration Costs0.02 0.04 0.04 0.06     Taxable adjustments0.19 0.21 0.37 0.34Tax Act items0.13 — 0.13 —Tax impact of adjustments (a)(0.05) (0.07) (0.11) (0.12)Adjusted earnings per share (Non-GAAP)$0.79 $0.39 $1.32 $0.75(a) Calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate, adjusted to exclude the net $16.1 million charges associated with the Tax Act, as well as $1.5 million and $3.0 million of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017.

At December 31, 2017, net working capital was $465.1 million, compared to $244.6 million at June 30, 2017. At the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases.At December 31, 2017, $134.5 million of the $366.5 million of Cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $57.0 million of Cash and cash equivalents were held by regulated entities. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months 33Table of Contentsand thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to pay foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. Under the Tax Act, as a result of the U.S. federal transition tax and the withholding tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings at December 31, 2017, certain historical foreign earnings will be available to be repatriated back to the U.S at a future date for general corporate purposes. However, while we may do so at a future date, the Company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations.Outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Company's borrowing arrangements were as follows: ExpirationDate Principal amount outstanding at December 31, 2017 Carrying value at December 31, 2017 Carrying value at June 30, 2017 UnusedAvailableCapacity Fair Value at December 31, 2017     (in millions)              Long-term debt           Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit FacilityFebruary 2022 $330.0 $330.0 $210.0 $670.0 $330.0Fiscal 2014 Senior NotesSeptember 2020 400.0 398.2 397.9 — 414.2Fiscal 2016 Senior NotesJune 2026 500.0 494.5 494.1 — 496.1Total debt  $1,230.0 $1,222.7 $1,102.1 $670.0 $1,240.2Future principal payments on the Company's outstanding debt are as follows:Years ending June 30, 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total(in millions) $— $— $— $400.0 $330.0 $500.0 $1,230.0The Company has a $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the “Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility”), which is comprised of a $900.0 million U.S. dollar tranche and a $100.0 million multicurrency tranche. Borrowings under the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. In addition, the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility has an annual facility fee equal to 12.5 basis points on the entire facility, which totaled $0.3 million and $0.6 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 respectively, and $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $330.0 million in outstanding borrowings and had unused available capacity of $670.0 million under the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility. The facility is scheduled to expire in February 2022.At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the Company's outstanding Long-term debt was $1,222.7 million, consisting of: (i) borrowings on the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility of $330.0 million, (ii) senior notes of $398.2 million ($400.0 million principal amount less $0.2 million bond discount and $1.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due September 2020 and (iii) senior notes of $494.5 million ($500.0 million principal amount less $1.8 million bond discount and $3.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due June 2026. The Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility and the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are ranked equally in right of payment. Interest on the senior notes due 2020 is payable semiannually on March 1st and September 1st each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.95%. Interest on the senior notes due 2026 is payable semiannually on June 27th and December 27th each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.40%. Our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios.34Table of ContentsCash Flows Six Months Ended  December 31,     Change 2017 2016 $ (in millions)Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities$141.8 $(5.5) $147.3Net cash flows used in investing activities$(85.4) $(553.4) $468.0Net cash flows provided by financing activities$35.4 $70.2 $(34.7)      Free cash flow:     Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities (GAAP)$141.8 $(5.5) $147.3Capital expenditures and Software purchases and capitalized internal use software(52.5) (32.0) (20.5)Free cash flow (Non-GAAP)$89.3 $(37.5) $126.8The increase in cash provided by operating activities of $147.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to: (i) an increase in cash provided by advanced client payments on existing contracts of $73.1 million, (ii) higher cash generated from our operations primarily due to higher event-driven activity partially offset by increased cash used in working capital, and (iii) the classification of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation awards as part of operating activities in fiscal year 2018, for which $22.0 million of excess tax benefits were classified in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 rather than operating activities.  The decrease in cash used in investing activities of $468.0 million in the six months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflects decreased (i) acquisitions of $398.3 million largely driven by the acquisition of NACC in fiscal year 2017 and (ii) $90.0 million in purchased intellectual property, partially offset by (iii) increased Capital expenditures and Software purchases and capitalized internal use software of $20.5 million.The decreased cash provided by financing activities of $34.7 million in the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflects: (i) a decrease in net proceeds from borrowings of $70.0 million, (ii) a $29.7 million decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options, (iii) a $22.0 million decrease in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stock-based compensation awards that are no longer classified as cash flows from financing activities, and (iv) a $6.4 million increase in dividends paid, partially offset by (v) $98.2 million decrease in the repurchase of common stock.SeasonalityProcessing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter (the second quarter of the calendar year). The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds. Historically, this has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter. The seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.Income Taxes  Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 was 40.0% and 37.0% compared to 34.1% and 34.4% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily attributable to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. With a fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the Company's federal corporate statutory income 35Table of Contentstax rate will be subject to a full year blended tax rate of 28.1%. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate statutory income tax rate, the Tax Act requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, which the Company has estimated to be $11.4 million. The Company also accrued $20.8 million of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for U.S. tax purposes. Partially offsetting the $32.2 million of aggregate expense related to foreign earnings is a $16.1 million benefit related to the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities. Beginning July 1, 2018, the Company will be subject to a U.S. federal corporate statutory income tax rate of 21.0%. Contractual ObligationsIn March 2010, the Company and International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM provides certain aspects of the Company's information technology infrastructure. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provides a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, open systems, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The migration of data center processing to IBM was completed in August 2012. The IT Services Agreement would have expired on June 30, 2022. In March 2015, the Company signed a two-year extension to the IT Services Agreement which expires on June 30, 2024. The Company has the right to renew the term of the IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term. Commitments remaining under this agreement at December 31, 2017 are $361.8 million through fiscal year 2024, the final year of the contract. In March 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited (“IBM UK”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “EU IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company's technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia. The EU IT Services Agreement expires in October 2023. The Company has the right to renew the initial term of the EU IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term or one additional 24-month term. Commitments remaining under this agreement at December 31, 2017 are $29.0 million through fiscal year 2024, the final year of the contract. The Company expects to pay $40.0 million to an affiliate of Inveshare in February 2018 upon delivery of certain new blockchain technology applications. The Company contributed $2.8 million to an equity method investment during the six months ended December 31, 2017, and has a remaining commitment of $2.5 million to fund this investment at December 31, 2017.Other Commercial AgreementsAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $330.0 million of outstanding borrowings and unused available capacity of $670.0 million under the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility.Certain of the Company's subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. There were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at December 31, 2017.Off-balance Sheet ArrangementsIt is not the Company's business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2017 or at June 30, 2017. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company's products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties or collateral arrangements.Recently-issued Accounting PronouncementsPlease refer to Note 2, “New Accounting Pronouncements” to our Financial Statements under Item 1. of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for a discussion on the impact of new accounting pronouncements.36Table of ContentsItem 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThere have been no material changes related to market risk from the disclosures in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESManagement's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017.
