NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



			 

		



1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


Basis of Presentation


The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Alliance Data Systems Corporation (“ADSC” or, including its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIEs”), the “Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2018. 


The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to state fairly the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the fiscal year.


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (1) the reported amounts of assets; (2) liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and (3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 


 For purposes of comparability, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, certain statement of cash flow reclassifications were made for the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-18, “Restricted Cash.” The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to the total of the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards


In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” that replaces existing lease guidance. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of income. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption and various optional practical expedients permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements” that provides transition relief by removing certain comparative period requirements and recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption, which is January 1, 2019 for the Company. The new standard may be applied using this additional transition method or a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements, but expects an increase in assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets at adoption for the recording of right-of-use assets and corresponding

lease liabilities. The Company continues to assess the impact of adoption of the new standard on its existing policies, processes, systems and controls in conjunction with its review of existing lease agreements.  


In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires entities to utilize a financial instrument impairment model to establish an allowance based on expected losses over the life of the exposure rather than a model based on an incurred loss approach. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity's assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance. In addition, ASU 2016-13 modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements.


In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.” ASU 2017-12 expands and refines the hedge accounting model for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. ASU 2017-12 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2017-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 


In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2018-02 allows for reclassification of stranded tax effects on items resulting from the change in the corporate tax rate as a result of H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Tax effects unrelated to H.R. 1 are permitted to be released from accumulated other comprehensive income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach, based on the nature of the underlying item. ASU 2018-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2018-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 


Recently Adopted Accounting Standards


In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. Companies may adopt ASC 606 using a full retrospective or modified retrospective method. 


 


During 2017, the Company completed its evaluation of ASC 606, including the impact on its processes and controls, and differences in the timing and/or method of revenue recognition. As a result, the Company identified changes to and modified certain of its accounting policies and practices. Although there were no significant changes to the Company's accounting systems or controls upon adoption of ASC 606, the Company modified certain of its existing controls to incorporate the revisions made to its accounting policies and practices. 


 


The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company's adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or cash flows. ASC 606 does not apply to financial instruments and other contractual rights or obligations (for example, interest income and late fees from credit card and loan receivables), and therefore, the Company's finance charges, net were not affected by the adoption of the standard. Most revenue streams are recorded consistently under both ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition” and the new standard; however, the Company noted the following impacts:


 



 ·



Upon the adoption of ASC 606, revenue associated with a database build was changed from recognizing revenue over the expected contract term upon client acceptance to over the build period in which the database is completed, because the Company's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The cumulative effect of the changes made to the consolidated January 1, 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in an

Further, ASC 606 impacted the presentation of revenue within the Company's coalition loyalty program. Upon the adoption of ASC 606, for the fulfillment of certain rewards where the AIR MILES® Reward Program does not control the goods or services before they are transferred to the collector, revenue is recorded on a net basis.

 



 ·



ASC 606 also requires expanded disclosure regarding the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue transactions. See Note 2, “Revenue,” for the Company's ASC 606 disclosures.

 


In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” ASU 2016-01 requires that equity investments be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, entities have the option to either measure these investments at fair value or at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. Additionally, ASU 2016-01 requires entities that elect the fair value option for financial liabilities to recognize changes in fair value related to instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. Finally, entities must assess valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale debt securities in combination with their other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018, resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment of $1.5 million that was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings on the consolidated January 1, 2018 balance sheet. 


In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” ASU 2016-15 makes eight targeted changes to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company's adoption of this standard on January 1, 2018 did not have a material impact on its consolidated statements of cash flows.


In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018. The effect of the adoption of the standard was to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents at the beginning-of-period and end-of-period cash and cash equivalents totals.

2. REVENUE


Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” applying the modified retrospective method to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historic accounting under ASC 605. ASC 606 does not apply to financial instruments and other contractual rights or obligations.


Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company's contracts with its customers state the terms of sale, including the description, quantity, and price of the product or service purchased. Payment terms can vary by contract, but the period between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. Taxes assessed on revenue-producing transactions are excluded from revenues.


The Company's products and services are reported under three segments—LoyaltyOne, Epsilon and Card Services, and are listed below. The following presents revenue disaggregated by major source, as well as geographic region which is based on the location of the subsidiary that generally correlates with the location of the customer:

LoyaltyOne


LoyaltyOne provides coalition and short-term loyalty programs through the Company's Canadian AIR MILES Reward Program and BrandLoyalty. The AIR MILES Reward Program is a coalition loyalty program for sponsors, who pay LoyaltyOne a fee per AIR MILES reward mile issued, in return for which LoyaltyOne provides all marketing, customer service, rewards and redemption management. BrandLoyalty designs, implements, conducts and evaluates innovative and tailor-made short-term loyalty programs for grocers worldwide. 


Total consideration from the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles is allocated to three performance obligations: redemption, service, and brand, based on a relative standalone selling price basis. The estimated standalone selling price for the redemption and the service performance obligations are based on cost plus a reasonable margin. The estimated standalone selling price of the brand performance obligation is determined using a relief from royalty approach. Accordingly, management determines the estimated standalone selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods, including discounted cash flows and available market data in consideration of applicable margins and royalty rates to utilize. The number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and redeemed are factored into the estimates, as management estimates the standalone selling prices and volumes over the term of the respective agreements in order to determine the allocation of consideration to each performance obligation delivered. The redemption performance obligation incorporates the expected number of AIR MILES reward miles to be redeemed, and therefore, the amount of redemption revenue recognized is subject to management's estimate of breakage, or those AIR MILES reward miles estimated to be unredeemed by the collector base. 


Redemption revenue is recognized at a point in time, as the AIR MILES reward miles are redeemed. For the fulfillment of certain rewards where the AIR MILES Reward Program does not control the goods or services before they are transferred to the collector, revenue is recorded on a net basis. Service revenue is recognized over time using a time-elapsed output method, the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile. Revenue from the brand is recognized over time, using an output method, when an AIR MILES reward mile is issued. Revenue associated with both the service and brand is included in service revenue in the Company's consolidated statements of income.


The amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimate of breakage and the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile. Breakage and the life of an AIR MILES reward mile are based on management's estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis, current run rates and other pertinent factors, such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure. As of June 30, 2018, the breakage rate was 20% and the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile was 38 months.

The short-term loyalty programs typically last between 12 and 20 weeks, depending on the nature of the program, with contract terms usually less than one year in length. These programs are tailored for the specific retailer client and are designed to reward key customer segments based on their spending levels during defined campaign periods. Revenue is recognized at the point in time control passes from BrandLoyalty to the retailer.


Contract Liabilities. The Company records a contract liability when cash payments are received in advance of its performance, which applies to the service and redemption of an AIR MILES reward mile and the reward products for its short-term loyalty programs.

The deferred redemption obligation associated with the AIR MILES Reward Program is effectively due on demand from the collector base, thus the timing of revenue recognition is based on the redemption by the collector. Service revenue is amortized over the expected life of a mile, with the deferred revenue balance expected to be recognized into revenue in the amount of $86.8 million in 2018, $104.0 million in 2019, $55.1 million in 2020, and $11.5 million in 2021. 


 


Additionally, contract liabilities for the Company's short-term loyalty programs are recognized in other current liabilities in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The beginning balance as of January 1, 2018 was $87.5 million and the closing balance as of June 30, 2018 was $65.7 million, with the change due to revenue recognized of approximately $190.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018, offset in part by cash payments received in advance of program performance.

Epsilon generally enters into multi-year agreements with its customers; however, these contracts provide for termination without penalty with prior written notice. Under ASC 606, this results in a contract term shorter than the stated contractual term.


The Company's contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price based on either the adjusted market assessment or cost plus a margin approach.  


Certain of Epsilon's contracts may provide for returns or cash consideration payable to its customers, which is accounted for as variable consideration. The Company estimates these amounts based on either the expected amount or most likely amount to be provided to the customer to determine the transaction price for the contract. The estimation method is consistent for contracts with similar terms and is applied consistently throughout each contract. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available.


The Company generates revenue from commission fees for transactions occurring on the Company's affiliate marketing networks. Commission fee revenue is recognized on a net basis as the Company acts as an agent.


Contract Liabilities. The Company records a contract liability when cash payments are received or due in advance of its performance. Contract liabilities for Epsilon are recognized in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The beginning balance as of January 1, 2018 was $22.8 million and the closing balance as of June 30, 2018 was $23.7 million.


Contract Costs. The Company recognizes an asset for the direct costs incurred to fulfill its contracts with customers to the extent it expects to recover those costs in accordance with ASC 340-40, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs –

Contracts with Customers.” As of June 30, 2018, the remaining unamortized contract costs were $6.1 million. Contract fulfillment costs are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis through the period in which the future performance obligation is satisfied. No impairment was recognized during the periods presented.


Card Services


Card Services is a provider of branded credit card programs, both private label and co-brand, which drives sales for its brand partners. For these private label and co-brand programs, Card Services provides risk management solutions, account origination, funding, transaction processing, customer care, collections and marketing services. 


Finance charges, net. Finance charges, net represents revenue earned on customer accounts owned by the Company, and is recognized in the period in which it is earned. The Company recognizes earned finance charges, interest income and fees on credit card and loan receivables in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements. Interest and fees continue to accrue on all credit card accounts beyond 90 days, except in limited circumstances, until the credit card account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged-off, typically at 180 days delinquent. Charge-offs for unpaid interest and fees as well as any adjustments to the allowance associated with unpaid interest and fees are recorded as a reduction to finance charges, net. Pursuant to ASC 310-20, “Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs,” direct loan origination costs on credit card and loan receivables are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one-year period and recorded as a reduction to finance charges, net.


Servicing fees, net. Servicing fees, net represents revenue earned from retailers and cardholders from processing and servicing accounts, and is recognized as such services are performed. 


Revenue earned from retailers primarily consists of merchant and interchange fees, which are transaction fees charged to the merchant for the processing of credit card transactions. Merchant and interchange fees are recognized at a point in time upon the cardholder purchase. Our credit card program agreements may also provide for payments to the retailer based on purchased volume or if certain contractual incentives are met, such as if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. These amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. 


Revenue earned from cardholders primarily consists of monthly fees from the purchase of certain payment protection products purchased by our cardholders. The fees are based on the average cardholder account balance, and these products can be cancelled at any time by the cardholder. Revenue is recognized over time using a time-elapsed output method.  


Contract Costs. The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining or fulfilling a contract with the retailer for a credit card program agreement to the extent it expects to recover those costs, in accordance with ASC 340-40. As of June 30, 2018, the remaining unamortized contract costs were $386.8 million and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Contract costs are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective term of the agreement, which represents the period of service. Depending on the nature of the contract costs, the amortization is recorded as a reduction to revenue, or costs of operations, in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. Amortization of contract costs recorded as a reduction to revenue totaled $15.4 million and $32.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Amortization of contract costs recorded to cost of operations expense totaled $2.1 million and $4.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. No impairment was recognized during the periods presented.


Practical Expedients


The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.


The Company has elected the practical expedient from ASC 340-40 with respect to contract costs, and expenses the incremental costs as incurred for those costs that would otherwise be recognized with an amortization period of one year or less. These costs are primarily related to sales commissions, and such expensed incremental costs are recorded to cost of operations expense in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.

4. ACQUISITIONS


2017 Acquisitions:


On October 20, 2017, the Company acquired credit card receivables and the associated accounts and assumed a portion of an existing customer care operation, including a facility sublease agreement and approximately 250 employees, from Signet Jewelers Limited (“Signet”) for cash consideration of approximately $945.6 million. This acquisition increases the Company's presence in the jewelry vertical. The Company determined these acquired activities and assets constituted a business under ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” based on the nature of the inputs, processes and outputs acquired from the transaction. In addition, the parties entered into a long-term agreement under which the Company became the primary issuer of private-label credit cards and related marketing services for Signet. The Company obtained control of the assets and assumed the liabilities on October 20, 2017, and the results of operations have been included since the date of acquisition in the Company's Card Services segment. 


The Company engaged a third party specialist to assist it in the measurement of the fair value of the assets acquired. The fair value of the assets acquired exceeded the cost of the acquisition. Consequently, the Company reassessed the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and concluded that the valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. The excess value of the net assets acquired over the purchase price of $7.9 million was recorded as a bargain purchase gain, which was included in cost of operations in the Company's consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Allowance for Loan Loss


The Company maintains an allowance for loan loss at a level that is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in credit card and loan receivables. The allowance for loan loss covers forecasted uncollectible principal as well as unpaid interest and fees. The allowance for loan loss is evaluated monthly for appropriateness.


In estimating the allowance for principal loan losses, management utilizes a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card and loan receivables. Migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a credit card or loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge-off. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan loss. Charge-offs of principal amounts, net of recoveries are deducted from the allowance. In estimating the allowance for uncollectible unpaid interest and fees, the Company utilizes historical charge-off trends, analyzing actual charge-offs for the prior three months. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to finance charges, net. In evaluating the allowance for loan loss for both principal and unpaid interest and fees, management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience, including seasoning and growth, account collection strategies, economic conditions, bankruptcy filings, policy changes, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties.

Net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses from credit cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances, as well as bankrupt and deceased credit cardholders, less recoveries and exclude charged-off interest, fees and fraud losses. Charged‑off interest and fees reduce finance charges, net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, are charged-off in the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged-off in each month subsequent to 60 days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case, not later than the 180-day contractual time frame. 


The Company records the actual charge-offs for unpaid interest and fees as a reduction to finance charges, net. Actual charge-offs for unpaid interest and fees were $182.0 million and $160.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $381.5 million and $317.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.


Delinquencies


A credit card account is contractually delinquent if the Company does not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder's statement. It is the Company's policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts beyond 90 days, except in limited circumstances, until the credit card account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged-off, typically at 180 days delinquent. When an account becomes delinquent, a message is printed on the credit cardholder's billing statement requesting payment. After an account becomes 30 days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent. The collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account. If the Company is unable to make a collection after exhausting all in-house collection efforts, the Company may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.

Modified Credit Card Receivables


The Company holds certain credit card receivables for which the terms have been modified. The Company's modified credit card receivables include credit card receivables for which temporary hardship concessions have been granted and credit card receivables in permanent workout programs. These modified credit card receivables include concessions consisting primarily of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction. The temporary programs' concessions remain in place for a period no longer than twelve months, while the permanent programs remain in place through the payoff of the credit card receivables if the credit cardholder complies with the terms of the program. These concessions do not include the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may involve the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. In the case of the temporary programs, at the end of the concession period, credit card receivable terms revert to standard rates. These arrangements are automatically terminated if the customer fails to make payments in accordance with the terms of the program, at which time their account reverts back to its original terms.


Credit card receivables for which temporary hardship and permanent concessions were granted are each considered troubled debt restructurings and are collectively evaluated for impairment. Modified credit card receivables are evaluated at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the credit card receivable balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected. Consistent with the Company's measurement of impairment of modified credit card receivables on a pooled basis, the discount rate used for credit card receivables is the average current annual percentage rate the Company applies to non-impaired credit card receivables, which approximates what would have been applied to the pool of modified credit card receivables prior to impairment. In assessing the appropriate allowance for loan loss, these modified credit card receivables are included in the general pool of credit card receivables with the allowance determined under the contingent loss model of ASC 450-20, “Loss Contingencies.” If the Company applied accounting under ASC 310-40, “Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors,” to the modified credit card receivables in these programs, there would not be a material difference in the allowance for loan loss.


The Company had $347.9 million and $260.2 million, respectively, as a recorded investment in impaired credit card receivables with an associated allowance for loan loss of $97.3 million and $56.1 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. These modified credit card receivables represented less than 2% of the Company's total credit card receivables as of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.


The average recorded investment in impaired credit card receivables was $423.3 million and $219.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $359.8 million and $216.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 


Interest income on these modified credit card receivables is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing credit card receivables. Cash collections on these modified credit card receivables are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to credit card receivables that are not in such programs. The Company recognized $9.3 million and $4.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $15.3 million and $9.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in interest income associated with modified credit card receivables during the period that such credit card receivables were impaired.

Credit Quality


The Company uses proprietary scoring models developed specifically for the purpose of monitoring the Company's obligor credit quality. The proprietary scoring models are used as a tool in the underwriting process and for making credit decisions. The proprietary scoring models are based on historical data and require various assumptions about future performance, which the Company updates periodically. Information regarding customer performance is factored into these proprietary scoring models to determine the probability of an account becoming 91 or more days past due at any time within the next 12 months. Obligor credit quality is monitored at least monthly during the life of an account. The following table reflects the composition of the Company's credit card and loan receivables by obligor credit quality as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:

Transfer of Financial Assets


The Company originates loans under an agreement with one of its clients, and after origination, these loan receivables are sold to the client at par value plus accrued interest. These transfers qualify for sale treatment as they meet the conditions established in ASC 860-10, “Transfers and Servicing.” Following the sale, the client owns the loan receivables, bears the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults and is responsible for all servicing functions related to the loan receivables. The loan receivables originated by the Company that have not yet been sold to the client were $78.8 million and $126.9 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and are included in credit card and loan receivables held for sale in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of these loan receivables approximates fair value due to the short duration between the date of origination and sale. Originations and sales of these loan receivables held for sale are reflected as operating activities in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Effective July 2, 2018, the Company no longer originates loan receivables for this client.

Portfolios Held for Sale


The Company has certain credit card portfolios held for sale, which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, of $905.4 million and $899.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.


In the first quarter of 2018, the Company transferred one credit card portfolio totaling approximately $82.4 million out of credit card and loan receivables held for sale and into credit card and loan receivables, and transferred one credit card portfolio totaling approximately $90.1 million into credit card and loan receivables held for sale. The portfolio was transferred into credit card and loan receivables held for sale at the net carrying amount, inclusive of the related reserves for losses, as the fair value was estimated to be greater than the net carrying amount, and such amount will be the measurement basis until the sale of the portfolio.


In the second quarter of 2018, the Company transferred one credit card portfolio totaling approximately $54.6 million into credit card and loan receivables held for sale. The portfolio was transferred at the net carrying amount, inclusive of the related reserves for losses, as the fair value was estimated to be greater than the net carrying amount, and which was the measurement basis until the portfolio was sold in June 2018. The Company received preliminary cash consideration of approximately $55.6 million from the sale of the credit card portfolio, and the Company recognized a de minimis gain on the transaction.


Additionally, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded valuation adjustments of $14.2 million and $35.9 million, respectively, to reduce the value of certain portfolios within credit card and loan receivables held for sale. The Company carries its credit card and loan receivables held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value.


Securitized Credit Card Receivables


The Company regularly securitizes its credit card receivables through its credit card securitization trusts, consisting of World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust (“Master Trust I”) and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III (“Master Trust III”) (collectively, the “WFN Trusts”), and World Financial Capital Credit Card Master Note Trust (the “WFC Trust”). The Company continues to own and service the accounts that generate credit card receivables held by the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust. In its capacity as a servicer, each of the respective banks earns a fee from the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust to service and administer the credit card receivables, collect payments and charge-off uncollectible receivables. These fees are eliminated and therefore are not reflected in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.


The WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust are VIEs and the assets of these consolidated VIEs include certain credit card receivables that are restricted to settle the obligations of those entities and are not expected to be available to the Company or its creditors. The liabilities of the consolidated VIEs include non-recourse secured borrowings and other liabilities for which creditors or beneficial interest holders do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company.

6. INVENTORIES, NET


Inventories, net of $233.2 million and $234.1 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, primarily consist of finished goods to be utilized as rewards in the Company's loyalty programs. Inventories, net are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value and valued primarily on a first-in-first-out basis. The Company records valuation adjustments to its inventories if the cost of inventory exceeds the amount it expects to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management's judgment regarding future market conditions and an analysis of historical experience.


7. OTHER INVESTMENTS


Other investments consist of marketable securities and U.S. Treasury bonds and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Market values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the security's issuer, and the Company's intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities with low probabilities of default and has the intent and ability to hold the investments until maturity. As of June 30, 2018, the Company does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.


There were no realized gains or losses from the sale of investment securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

Asset-Backed Term Notes


In February 2018, $500.0 million of Series 2013-A asset-backed term notes, $125.0 million of which were retained by the Company and eliminated from the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, matured and were repaid.


In February 2018, Master Trust I issued $591.5 million of Series 2018-A asset-backed term notes, which mature in February 2021.

The Company enters into foreign currency derivatives to reduce the volatility of the Company's cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with certain inventory transactions, some of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks for periods of 12 months or less. As of June 30, 2018, the maximum term over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability of future cash flows associated with certain inventory transactions is 12 months.


Certain foreign currency exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedges as they do not meet the specific hedge accounting requirements of ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income as they occur. Gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are included in other operating activities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented.


The following tables present the fair values of the derivative instruments included within the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments


Gains of $1.4 million and $1.3 million, net of tax, were recognized in other comprehensive income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, related to foreign currency exchange hedges designated as effective. Losses of $0.6 million and $0.9 million, net of tax, were recognized in other comprehensive income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, related to foreign currency exchange hedges designated as effective.


Changes in the fair value of these hedges, excluding any ineffective portion are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions affect net income. The ineffective portion of these cash flow hedges impacts net income when ineffectiveness occurs. Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income (cost of operations) for each of the periods presented were not material. At June 30, 2018, $1.2 million is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income in the coming 12 months.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments


For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, gains of $1.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively, related to foreign currency exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in general and administrative expense in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.


For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, gains of $9.1 million and $6.4 million, respectively, related to foreign currency exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in general and administrative expense in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.


Net Investment Hedges


The Company designated its Euro-denominated 5.250% senior notes due 2023 (€300.0 million) and €200.0 million of its Euro-denominated 4.500% senior notes due 2022 (€400.0 million) as a net investment hedge of its investment in BrandLoyalty, on a pre-tax basis. The net investment hedge is intended to reduce the volatility in stockholders' equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. dollar. 


In February 2018, the Company de-designated its €500.0 million net investment hedge and re-designated €640.0 million of Euro-denominated senior notes as a net investment hedge of its investment in BrandLoyalty on an after-tax basis. The change in fair value of the net investment hedges due to remeasurement of the effective portion is recorded in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of this hedging instrument impacts net income when the ineffectiveness occurs. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, gains of $31.0 million and $19.3 million, net of tax, respectively, were recognized in other comprehensive income and no ineffectiveness was recorded on the net investment hedges. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, losses of $23.8 million and $27.4 million, net of tax, respectively, were recognized in other comprehensive income and no ineffectiveness was recorded on the net investment hedges.

During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company awarded 263,542 performance-based restricted stock units with a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $240.65 as determined on the date of grant with pre-defined vesting criteria that permit a range from 0% to 150% to be earned. If the performance targets are met, the restrictions will lapse with respect to 33% of the award on February 15, 2019, an additional 33% of the award on February 15, 2020 and the final 34% of the award on February 18, 2021, provided that the participant is employed by the Company on each such vesting date.


During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company also awarded 28,057 restricted stock units with a market-based condition subject to pre-defined vesting criteria that permit a range from 0% to 175% to be earned.

Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income for each of the periods presented were not material. Additionally, as of January 1, 2018, a cumulative-effect adjustment of $1.5 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings related to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” For more information, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”


 


14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


In accordance with ASC 825, “Financial Instruments,” the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate fair value. To obtain fair values, observable market prices are used if available. In some instances, observable market prices are not readily available and fair value is determined using present value or other techniques appropriate for a particular financial instrument. These techniques involve judgment and as a result are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions or estimation techniques may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.


Fair Value of Financial Instruments  — The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows:

The following techniques and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments as disclosed herein:


Credit card and loan receivables, net — The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model using unobservable inputs, including estimated yields (interest and fee income), loss rates, payment rates and discount rates to estimate the fair value measurement of the credit card and loan receivables.


Credit card and loan receivables held for sale — The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model using unobservable inputs, including forecasted yields and net charge-off estimates to estimate the fair value measurement of the credit card portfolios held for sale. Loan receivables held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, and their carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short duration of the holding period of the loan receivables prior to sale. 


Redemption settlement assets, restricted — Redemption settlement assets, restricted are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities. 


Other investments — Other investments consist of marketable securities and U.S. Treasury bonds and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Other investments are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities. 


Deposits — The fair value is estimated based on the current observable market rates available to the Company for similar deposits with similar remaining maturities.


Non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities — The fair value is estimated based on the current observable market rates available to the Company for similar debt instruments with similar remaining maturities or quoted market prices for the same transaction.


Long-term and other debt — The fair value is estimated based on the current observable market rates available to the Company for similar debt instruments with similar remaining maturities or quoted market prices for the same transaction.


Derivative instruments — The Company's foreign currency cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflected the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is estimated based on published quotations of spot foreign currency rates and forward points which are converted into implied foreign currency rates.


Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Fair Value Hierarchy


ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: 


Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 


Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 


Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs where little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.


Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 financial instruments also include those for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The use of different techniques to determine fair value of these financial instruments could result in different estimates of fair value at the reporting date.

15. INCOME TAXES


For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company utilized an effective tax rate of 14.4% and 19.3%, respectively, to calculate its provision for income taxes.  For each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company utilized an effective tax rate of 35.6%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the reduction in the federal statutory rate pursuant to tax reform enacted in December 2017 and a tax benefit associated with foreign restructuring in the current year quarter, offset in part by the negative impact of the Supreme Court's recent decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.

16. SEGMENT INFORMATION


Operating segments are defined by ASC 280, “Segment Reporting,” as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company's chief operating decision maker is the President and Chief Executive Officer. The operating segments are reviewed separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit that generally offers different products.


The Company operates in the following reportable segments: LoyaltyOne, Epsilon, and Card Services. Segment operations consist of the following:


LoyaltyOne provides coalition and short-term loyalty programs through the Company's Canadian AIR MILES Reward Program and BrandLoyalty;


Epsilon provides end-to-end, integrated marketing solutions that leverage rich data, analytics, creativity and technology to help clients more effectively acquire, retain and grow relationships with their customers; and


Card Services provides risk management solutions, account origination, funding, transaction processing, customer care, collections and marketing services for the Company's private label and co-brand credit card programs.


Corporate and other immaterial businesses are reported collectively as an “all other” category labeled “Corporate/Other.” Income taxes are not allocated to the segments in the computation of segment operating profit for internal evaluation purposes and have also been included in “Corporate/Other.”

Three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017


Revenue.  Total revenue increased $82.1 million, or 5%, to $1,903.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 from $1,821.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The net increase was due to the following:


Services. Revenue decreased $17.0 million, or 3%, to $609.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as a result of a $20.2 million decrease in marketing services revenue primarily due to declines in lower margin pass-through agency and site-based display product offerings, offset in part by a $5.6 million increase in merchant fees, which are transaction fees charged to the retailer, as a result of decreased payments to clients.  


Redemption, net. Revenue decreased $37.0 million, or 20%, to $147.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606, which negatively impacted revenue by $66.3 million. Upon adoption of ASC 606, certain redemption revenue for which we do not control the good or service prior to transferring it to the collector is recorded on a net basis, which reduced both redemption revenue and cost of operations by $66.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. This decrease was partially offset by the increase of $28.0 million in redemption revenue from our short-term loyalty programs due to an increase in the number of active programs in market. 


Finance charges, net.  Revenue increased $136.1 million, or 13%, to $1,146.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, driven by higher average credit card and loan receivables, which impacted revenue by $151.5 million through a combination of recent credit card portfolio acquisitions and increased credit sales, offset in part by a decline in yield.


Cost of operations.  Cost of operations decreased $12.8 million, or 1%, to $1,001.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $1,014.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The net decrease was due to the following:


Within the LoyaltyOne segment, cost of operations decreased $44.4 million due to a $66.3 million decrease in cost of redemptions related to the adoption of ASC 606 as discussed above. This decrease was offset in part by a $25.9 million increase in cost of redemptions related to our short-term loyalty programs due to the increase in redemption revenue.


Within the Epsilon segment, cost of operations decreased $30.3 million, or 7%, due to a decrease in direct costs associated with a 5% decline in revenue.


Within the Card Services segment, cost of operations increased $62.6 million due to a 17% increase in payroll and benefit expenses to support in-house collections and operational initiatives, an 18% increase in marketing expenses to drive credit sales and additional professional fees to support operational initiatives. Further, other operating expenses increased due to higher credit card processing costs attributable to increases in volume associated with growth in credit card and loan receivables.


Provision for loan loss.  Provision for loan loss increased $23.8 million, or 8%, to $311.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $288.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in the provision for loan loss was driven by higher net charge-offs.


General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses increased $5.7 million, or 13%, to $48.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $42.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, due to an increase in charitable contributions and higher payroll and benefit costs, offset in part by a $3.1 million decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses realized.


Depreciation and other amortization. Depreciation and other amortization increased $3.4 million, or 7%, to $48.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $45.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, due to additional assets placed into service from recent capital expenditures.


Amortization of purchased intangibles.  Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased $6.9 million, or 9%, to $73.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $80.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets, including customer databases and portfolio premiums.

Interest expense, net.  Total interest expense, net increased $28.2 million, or 21%, to $165.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $137.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The increase was due to the following:



 ·



Securitization funding costs.  Securitization funding costs increased $18.6 million due to higher average interest rates, which increased funding costs by approximately $11.0 million, and higher average borrowings, which increased funding costs by approximately $7.6 million.


 ·



Interest expense on deposits.  Interest expense on deposits increased $8.2 million due to higher average borrowings, which increased interest expense by approximately $7.0 million, and higher average interest rates, which increased interest expense by approximately $1.2 million.


 ·



Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net.  Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net increased $1.4 million primarily due to a $9.2 million increase in interest expense on term debt and a $3.7 million increase in interest expense on the revolving line of credit due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates due to increases in the LIBOR rate. Additionally, amortization of debt issuance costs increased $1.7 million. These increases were offset in part by a $13.6 million decrease in interest expense on senior notes primarily due to the repayment of senior notes in December 2017 and April 2018. 

Taxes. Income tax expense decreased $39.4 million to $36.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 from $76.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, due to the reduction in the federal statutory rate pursuant to tax reform enacted in December 2017 and a tax benefit associated with foreign restructuring, offset in part by the negative impact of the Supreme Court's recent decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 14.4% as compared to 35.6% for the prior year quarter.


Six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017


Revenue.  Total revenue increased $87.3 million, or 2%, to $3,788.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 from $3,700.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The net increase was due to the following:


Services. Revenue decreased $33.5 million, or 3%, to $1,204.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as a result of a $33.8 million decrease in marketing services revenue due to declines in lower margin pass‑through agency and site-based display product offerings. 


Redemption, net. Revenue decreased $155.9 million, or 36%, to $279.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606, which negatively impacted revenue by $144.9 million. Upon adoption of ASC 606, certain redemption revenue for which we do not control the good or service prior to transferring it to the collector is recorded on a net basis, which reduced both redemption revenue and cost of operations by $144.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Additionally, redemption revenue from our short-term loyalty programs decreased 4% due to weakness in the first quarter of 2018. 


Finance charges, net.  Revenue increased $276.7 million, or 14%, to $2,304.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, driven by higher average credit card and loan receivables, which impacted revenue by $316.9 million through a combination of recent credit card portfolio acquisitions and increased credit sales, offset in part by a decline in yield.


Cost of operations.  Cost of operations decreased $41.0 million, or 2%, to $2,015.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $2,056.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The net decrease was due to the following:


Within the LoyaltyOne segment, cost of operations decreased $145.0 million due to a $144.9 million decrease in cost of redemptions related to the adoption of ASC 606 as discussed above.


Within the Epsilon segment, cost of operations decreased $54.2 million, or 6%, due to a decrease in direct costs associated with a 5% decline in revenue.


Within the Card Services segment, cost of operations increased $158.9 million due to a 17% increase in payroll and benefit expenses to support in-house collections and operational initiatives, a 15% increase in marketing expenses to drive credit sales and additional professional fees to support operational initiatives. Further, other 
 

40

 

Index

operating expenses increased due to higher credit card processing costs attributable to increases in volume associated with growth in credit card and loan receivables and valuation adjustments to certain portfolios within credit card and loan receivables held for sale.


Provision for loan loss.  Provision for loan loss increased $46.4 million, or 8%, to $649.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $603.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in the provision for loan loss was driven by an increase in net charge-offs.


General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses decreased $5.8 million, or 7%, to $81.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $87.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, due to a $7.8 million decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses realized, offset in part by an increase in charitable contributions.


Depreciation and other amortization. Depreciation and other amortization increased $6.4 million, or 7%, to $96.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $89.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, due to additional assets placed into service from recent capital expenditures.


Amortization of purchased intangibles.  Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased $13.0 million, or 8%, to $147.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $160.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets, including customer databases and portfolio premiums.


Interest expense, net.  Total interest expense, net increased $62.2 million, or 24%, to $324.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $262.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase was due to the following:



 ·



Securitization funding costs.  Securitization funding costs increased $35.5 million due to higher average borrowings, which increased funding costs by approximately $18.3 million, and higher average interest rates, which increased funding costs by approximately $17.2 million.


 ·



Interest expense on deposits.  Interest expense on deposits increased $17.7 million due to higher average borrowings, which increased interest expense by approximately $14.3 million, and higher average interest rates, which increased interest expense by approximately $3.4 million.


 ·



Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net.  Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net increased $9.0 million primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in interest expense on term debt and a $3.4 million increase in interest expense on the revolving line of credit due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates due to increases in the LIBOR rate. Additionally, amortization of debt issuance costs increased $2.2 million. These increases were offset in part by a $13.3 million decrease in interest expense on senior notes primarily due to the repayment of senior notes in December 2017 and April 2018.

Taxes. Income tax expense decreased $65.6 million to $91.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 from $157.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, due to the reduction in the federal statutory rate pursuant to tax reform enacted in December 2017 and a tax benefit associated with foreign restructuring in the current year quarter, offset in part by the negative impact of the Supreme Court's recent decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was 19.3% as compared to 35.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.


Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, plus stock compensation expense, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation and other amortization and amortization of purchased intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA, net is also a non-GAAP financial measure equal to adjusted EBITDA less securitization funding costs and interest expense on deposits.


We use adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management, and we believe it provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net are each considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our 
 

41

 

Index

businesses. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets, including certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets, such as capital expenditures, investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA also eliminates the non-cash effect of stock compensation expense.


Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net are not intended to represent funds available for dividends, reinvestment or other discretionary uses, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net measures presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.

Epsilon. Revenue decreased $29.6 million, or 5%, to $514.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, driven by double-digit declines in lower margin agency and site-based display product offerings as compared to the prior year period. 


Card Services.  Revenue increased $143.5 million, or 14%, to $1,148.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, driven by a $136.1 million increase in finance charges, net as a result of an increase in average credit card and loan receivables due to recent portfolio acquisitions and strong cardholder spending.

Asset Quality


 


Our delinquency and net charge-off rates reflect, among other factors, the credit risk of our credit card and loan receivables, the success of our collection and recovery efforts, and general economic conditions. 


Delinquencies. A credit card account is contractually delinquent when we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder's statement. Our policy is to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts beyond 90 days, except in limited circumstances, until the credit card account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged-off, typically at 180 days delinquent. When an account becomes delinquent, a message is printed on the credit cardholder's billing statement requesting payment. After an account becomes 30 days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent. The collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account. If we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in-house collection efforts, we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.

Net Charge-Offs. Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances, as well as bankrupt and deceased credit cardholders, less recoveries and exclude charged-off interest, fees and fraud losses. Charged-off interest and fees reduce finance charges, net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, are charged-off in the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged-off in each month subsequent to 60 days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case, not later than the 180-day contractual time frame.

Index




The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing net charge-offs of principal receivables for the period by the average credit card and loan receivables for the period. Average credit card and loan receivables represent the average balance of the cardholder receivables at the beginning of each month in the periods indicated.

Liquidity and Capital Resources


 


Our primary sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities, our credit agreements and issuances of debt or equity securities, our credit card securitization program and deposits issued by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. In addition to our efforts to renew and expand our current liquidity sources, we continue to seek new funding sources. 


Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. As of June 30, 2018, Comenity Bank's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.3%, Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.3%, total capital ratio was 15.6% and leverage ratio was 12.2%. As of June 30, 2018, Comenity Capital Bank's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.0%, Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.0%, total capital ratio was 16.3% and leverage ratio was 13.3%. Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are considered well capitalized.


Our primary uses of cash are for ongoing business operations, repayments of our debt, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends.


We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.


We believe that internally generated funds and other sources of liquidity discussed below will be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.


Cash Flow Activity


Operating Activities. We generated cash flow from operating activities of $1,321.8 million and $1,022.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows of $299.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 was due to an increase in profitability and an increase in cash provided by working capital. 


Investing Activities.  Cash used in investing activities was $236.2 million and $561.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Significant components of investing activities are as follows:



 ·

Cash decreased $181.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as we increased funding to the redemption settlement assets as a result of the breakage rate change in December 2016.

Debt. Cash decreased $279.4 million in net repayments for the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to net repayments under the revolving line of credit as well as the early repayment of $500.0 million 6.375% senior notes due 2020.  Cash increased $753.1 million in net borrowings for the six months ended June 30, 2017, due to the issuance of €400.0 million 4.500% senior notes due 2022 and net borrowings under the revolving line of credit.  


 ·



Non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities. Cash decreased $1,035.0 million and $395.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, due to net repayments and maturities under the asset-backed term notes and conduit facilities.


 ·



Deposits. Cash decreased $373.2 million and increased $332.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, due to timing of maturities.

Debt


Long-term and Other Debt


On April 2, 2018, we redeemed our $500.0 million outstanding 6.375% senior notes due April 1, 2020 at par plus accrued interest. We funded the redemption with borrowings under our revolving line of credit.


As of June 30, 2018, we had $752.0 million outstanding under our revolving line of credit and total availability of $820.4 million. Our total leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 2.5 to 1 at June 30, 2018, as compared to the maximum covenant ratio of 3.5 to 1. 


As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.


Deposits


We utilize money market deposits and certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities and fund securitization enhancement requirements of our bank subsidiaries, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. 


As of June 30, 2018, we had $3.4 billion in money market deposits outstanding with interest rates ranging from 1.48% to 2.60%. Money market deposits are redeemable on demand by the customer and, as such, have no scheduled maturity date. 


As of June 30, 2018, we had $7.2 billion in certificates of deposit outstanding with interest rates ranging from 1.13% to 4.00% and maturities ranging from July 2018 to July 2023. Certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements.

Securitization Program


 


We sell a majority of the credit card receivables originated by Comenity Bank to WFN Credit Company, LLC, which in turn sells them to World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust, or Master Trust I, and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III, or Master Trust III, or collectively, the WFN Trusts, as part of our credit card securitization program, which has been in existence since January 1996. We also sell our credit card receivables originated by Comenity Capital Bank to World Financial Capital Credit Company, LLC, which in turn sells them to World Financial Capital Master Note Trust, or the WFC Trust. These securitization programs are a principal vehicle through which we finance Comenity Bank's and Comenity Capital Bank's credit card receivables.


As of June 30, 2018, the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust had approximately $13.5 billion of securitized credit card receivables. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread deposits, additional receivables and subordinated classes. The credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust and by the performance of the credit card receivables in these credit card securitization trusts. 


At June 30, 2018, we had $7.8 billion of non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities, of which $2.5 billion is due within the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2018, total capacity under the conduit facilities was $4.5 billion, of which $2.9 billion had been drawn and was included in non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.


In February 2018, $500.0 million of Series 2013-A asset-backed term notes, $125.0 million of which were retained by us and eliminated from the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, matured and were repaid.


In February 2018, Master Trust I issued $591.5 million of Series 2018-A asset-backed term notes, which mature in February 2021. The offering consisted of $525.0 million of Class A notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.07% per year and $66.5 million of notes that were retained by us and eliminated from the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  


In April 2018, $500.0 million of Series 2015-A asset-backed term notes, $140.0 million of which were retained by us and eliminated from the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, matured and were repaid.
