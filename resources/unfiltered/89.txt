We had record second quarter revenue and are continuing to transform the company from a PC-centric to a data-centric company. Our data-centric businesses collectively grew 26% from a year ago and are now approaching 50% of our revenue. Individually, Data Center Group (DCG), Internet of Things Group (IOTG), Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG), and Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) all achieved double digit revenue growth. Client Computing Group (CCG) continued to execute well, producing 6% revenue growth and funding data-centric investments. Strong operating margin leverage and our lower tax rate resulted in GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth, even as we continued investing in growth areas. From a capital allocation perspective, in the first half of the year we generated $13.7 billion of cash flow from operations and returned $8.6 billion to shareholders.REVENUE OPERATING INCOME DILUTED EPS$17.0B   $5.3B $5.6B $1.05 $1.04GAAP   GAAP non-GAAP1 GAAP non-GAAP1up $2.2B or 15% from Q2 2017 up $1.4B or 37% from Q2 2017 up $1.4B or 34% from Q2 2017 up $0.47 or 82% from Q2 2017 up $0.32 or 44% from Q2 2017         Strong performance across all businesses and record revenue from IOTG and NSG Higher demand of performance-leading products and growth of adjacent businesses; offset by corresponding unit costs Top-line revenue growth, strong operating margin leverage, lower tax rate from Tax Reform2           ■ Data-centric $B ■ PC-centric $B ■ GAAP $B ■ Non-GAAP $B ■ GAAP ■ Non-GAAP  BUSINESS SUMMARY•Fifty years ago, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore founded Intel.

The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 Form 10-K. NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIESWe assess the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on our financial statements. The sections below describe impacts from newly adopted standards as well as material updates to our previous assessments, if any, from our 2017 Form 10-K. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTEDRetirement Benefits - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit CostStandard/Description: This amended standard was issued to provide additional guidance on the presentation of net periodic benefit cost in the income statement and on the components eligible for capitalization in assets. In accordance with the revised standard, we have separated the different components of net periodic benefit cost, presenting service cost components within operating income and other non-service components separately outside of operating income on the income statement. In addition, only service costs are now eligible for inventory capitalization.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2018. Changes to the presentation of benefit costs were required to be adopted retrospectively, while changes to the capitalization of service costs into inventories were required to be adopted prospectively. The standard permits, as a practical expedient, use of the amounts disclosed in the Retirement Benefit Plans footnote for the prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirement.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Adoption of the amended standard resulted in the reclassification of approximately $114 million of non-service net periodic benefit costs from line items within operating income to interest and other, net, for the year ended December 30, 2017 ($259 million for the year ended December 31, 2016). Revenue Recognition - Contracts with CustomersStandard/Description: This standard was issued to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by all companies. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2018. This standard was adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Our adoption assessments identified a change in revenue recognition timing on our component sales made to distributors. Under the new standard we now recognize revenue when we deliver to the distributor rather than deferring recognition until the distributor sells the components. On the date of initial application, we removed the deferred income and related receivables on component sales made to distributors through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. The revenue deferral that was historically recognized in the following period is expected to be primarily offset by the acceleration of revenue recognition in the current period as control of the product transfers to our customer.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements7Table of ContentsOur assessment also identified a change in expense recognition timing related to payments we make to our customers for distinct services they perform as part of cooperative advertising programs, which were previously recorded as operating expenses. We now recognize the expense for cooperative advertising in the period the marketing activities occur. Previously we recognized the expense in the period the customer was entitled to participate in the program, which coincided with the period of sale. On the date of initial adoption, we capitalized the expense of cooperative advertising not performed through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. We have completed our adoption and implemented policies, processes, and controls to support the standard's measurement and disclosure requirements. Refer to the tables below, which summarize the impacts of the changes discussed above to Intel's financial statements recorded as an adjustment to opening balances for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017, and also provide comparative reporting of the impacts of adopting the standard.Accounting Policy Updates: We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales.We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Any variable consideration is recognized as a reduction of net revenue at the time of revenue recognition. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. The impacts of distributor sales price reductions resulting from price protection agreements are also estimated based on historical analysis of such activity and are reflected as a reduction in net revenue. We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs, such as our Intel Inside® program, for marketing activities for certain of our products. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs as a reduction in revenue at the same time that the related revenue is recognized.Financial Instruments - Recognition and MeasurementStandard/Description: Requires changes to the accounting for financial instruments that primarily affect equity securities, financial liabilities measured using the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for such instruments.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2018. Changes to our marketable equity securities were required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017. Since management has elected to apply the measurement alternative to non-marketable equity securities, changes to these securities were adopted prospectively.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Marketable equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale equity investments are now measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through the income statement.All non-marketable equity securities formerly classified as cost method investments are measured and recorded using the measurement alternative. Equity securities measured and recorded using the measurement alternative are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Adjustments resulting from impairments and qualifying observable price changes are recorded in the income statement.Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, in accordance with the standard, recurring fair value disclosures are no longer provided for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative. In addition, the existing impairment model has been replaced with a new one-step qualitative impairment model. No initial adoption adjustment was recorded for these instruments since the standard was required to be applied prospectively for securities measured using the measurement alternative.We have completed our adoption and implemented policies, processes, and controls to support the standard's measurement and disclosure requirements. Refer to the table below, which summarizes impacts, net of tax, of the changes discussed above to Intel's financial statements. This reflects an adjustment to opening balances for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017. Accounting Policy Updates: We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:•Marketable equity securities are equity securities with readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value. Prior to fiscal 2018, these securities were measured and recorded at fair value and classified as available-for-sale securities. •Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative which measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. These securities were previously accounted for using the cost method of accounting, measured at cost less other-than-temporary impairment. •Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements8Table of ContentsRealized and unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in value and sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. We previously recorded unrealized gains and losses through other comprehensive income (loss) and realized gains and losses on the sale, exchange or impairment of these equity investments through gains (losses) on equity investments, net.The carrying value of our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities totaled $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2018 ($2.6 billion as of December 30, 2017). The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include industry and market conditions, the financial performance and near-term prospects of the investee, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our equity investments using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. Prior to fiscal 2018, non-marketable equity securities were tested for impairment using the other-than-temporary impairment model which considered the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. Impairments of non-marketable equity securities were $43 million in the first six months of 2018 and $325 million in the first six months of 2017.Opening Balance AdjustmentsThe following table summarizes the effects of adopting Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Customers, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement, and other accounting standards on our financial statements for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017 as an adjustment to the opening balance:    Adjustments from  (In Millions) Balance as ofDec 30, 2017 Revenue Standard Financial Instruments Standard Other1  Opening Balance as ofDec 31, 2017Assets:          Accounts receivable $5,607 $(530) $— $— $5,077Inventories $6,983 $47 $— $— $7,030Other current assets $2,908 $64 $— $(8) $2,964Equity investments $— $— $8,579 $— $8,579Marketable equity securities $4,192 $— $(4,192) $— $—Other long-term assets $7,602 $— $(4,387) $(43) $3,172           Liabilities:          Deferred income $1,656 $(1,356) $— $— $300Other accrued liabilities $7,535 $81 $— $— $7,616Deferred income taxes $3,046 $191 $— $(20) $3,217           Stockholders' equity:          Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $862 $— $(1,745) $(45) $(928)Retained earnings $42,083 $665 $1,745 $14 $44,5071 Includes adjustments from adoption of "Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory" and "Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income - Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements9Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the impacts of adopting the new revenue standard on our consolidated condensed statements of income and balance sheets:  Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Six Months Ended June 30, 2018(In Millions) As reported Adjustments Without new revenue standard As reported Adjustments Without new revenue standardIncome Statement                         Net revenue $16,962 $78 $17,040 $33,028 $(384) $32,644Cost of sales 6,543 (26) 6,517 12,878 (182) 12,696Gross margin 10,419 104 10,523 20,150 (202) 19,948Marketing, general and administrative 1,725 (18) 1,707 3,625 (70) 3,555Operating income 5,273 122 5,395 9,743 (132) 9,611Income before taxes 5,529 122 5,651 10,540 (132) 10,408Provision for taxes 523 23 546 1,080 (24) 1,056Net income $5,006 $99 $5,105 $9,460 $(108) $9,352                 As of June 30, 2018(In Millions)       As reported Adjustments Without new revenue standardBalance Sheet                         Assets:            Accounts receivable       $4,636 $482 $5,118Inventories       $7,344 $34 $7,378Other current assets       $3,398 $4 $3,402             Liabilities:            Deferred income       $— $1,677 $1,677Other accrued liabilities       $7,317 $(181) $7,136Deferred income taxes       $1,666 $(203) $1,463             Equity:            Retained earnings       $45,666 $(773) $44,893NOTE 3: OPERATING SEGMENTS We manage our business through the following operating segments:•Client Computing Group (CCG)•Data Center Group (DCG)•Internet of Things Group (IOTG)•Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG)•Programmable Solutions Group (PSG)•All OtherWe offer platform products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone System-on-Chip (SoC), or a multichip package. A platform product may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services offered by Intel. Platform products are used in various form factors across our CCG, DCG, and IOTG operating segments. We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products, which are our principal products and considered as one class of product. CCG and DCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements10Table of ContentsThe “all other” category includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:•results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, including Mobileye results;•historical results of operations from divested businesses, including Intel Security Group (ISecG) results; •results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business;   •amounts included within restructuring and other charges;  •a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and •acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), which is our interim Chief Executive Officer, does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except for these differences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.Net revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:  Three Months Ended Six Months Ended(In Millions) Jun 30, 2018 Jul 1, 2017 Jun 30, 2018 Jul 1, 2017Net revenue:        Client Computing Group        Platform $8,065 $7,634 $15,680 $15,031Adjacent 663 579 1,268 1,158  8,728 8,213 16,948 16,189Data Center Group        Platform 5,100 4,026 9,924 7,905Adjacent 449 346 859 699  5,549 4,372 10,783 8,604Internet of Things Group        Platform 745 614 1,464 1,246Adjacent 135 106 256 195  880 720 1,720 1,441Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group 1,079 874 2,119 1,740Programmable Solutions Group 517 440 1,015 865All other 209 144 443 720Total net revenue $16,962 $14,763 $33,028 $29,559         Operating income (loss):        Client Computing Group $3,234 $3,025 $6,025 $6,056Data Center Group 2,737 1,661 5,339 3,148Internet of Things Group 243 139 470 244Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (65) (110) (146) (239)Programmable Solutions Group 101 97 198 189All other (977) (970) (2,143) (1,924)Total operating income $5,273 $3,842 $9,743 $7,474FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements11Table of ContentsDisaggregated net revenue for each period was as follows:  Three Months Ended Six Months Ended(In Millions) Jun 30, 2018 Jul 1, 2017 Jun 30, 2018 Jul 1, 2017Platform revenue        Desktop platform $2,954 $2,776 $5,861 $5,631Notebook platform 5,086 4,816 9,775 9,314DCG platform 5,100 4,026 9,924 7,905Other platform1 770 656 1,508 1,332  13,910 12,274 27,068 24,182  —      Adjacent revenue2 3,052 2,489 5,960 4,843ISecG divested business — — — 534Total revenue $16,962 $14,763 $33,028 $29,5591 Includes our tablet, service provider, and IOTG platform revenue.2 Includes all of our non-platform products for CCG, DCG, and IOTG like modem, ethernet, and silicon photonics, as well as NSG, PSG, and Mobileye products.NOTE 4: EARNINGS PER SHARE We computed basic earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period.   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended(In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Jun 30, 2018 Jul 1, 2017 Jun 30, 2018 Jul 1, 2017Net income available to common stockholders $5,006 $2,808 $9,460 $5,772Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding – basic 4,649 4,710 4,661 4,717Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans 52 36 59 48Dilutive effect of convertible debt 46 99 48 99Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding – diluted 4,747 4,845 4,768 4,864Earnings per share – Basic $1.08 $0.60 $2.03 $1.22Earnings per share – Diluted $1.05 $0.58 $1.98 $1.19 Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs), and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. In December 2017, we paid cash to satisfy the conversion of our 2035 debentures, which we excluded from our dilutive earnings per share computation starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and are no longer dilutive. Our 2039 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion. Since the conversion premium is paid in cash or stock at our option, we determined the potentially dilutive shares of common stock by applying the treasury stock method. As of June 30, 2018, we paid cash to satisfy the conversion of a portion of our 2039 debentures. The potentially dilutive shares associated with the converted portion are excluded from our diluted earnings per share computation in the first six months of 2018 as they are no longer dilutive. In all periods presented, potentially dilutive outstanding securities which would have been antidilutive are insignificant and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. In all periods presented, we included our outstanding 2039 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because the average market price was above the conversion price. We could potentially exclude the 2039 debentures in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price.NOTE 5: CONTRACT LIABILITIES(In Millions) Jun 30, 2018 Opening Balance as of Dec 31, 2017Contract liabilities from prepaid supply agreements $2,704 $105Contract liabilities from software, services and other 115 195Total contract liabilities $2,819 $300Contract liabilities are primarily related to partial prepayments received from customers on long term supply agreements towards future NSG product delivery. As new prepaid supply agreements are entered into and performance obligations are negotiated, this component of the contract liability balance will increase, and as customers purchase product and utilize their prepaid balances, the balance will decrease. The short-term portion of prepayments from supply agreements is reported on the consolidated condensed balance sheets within other accrued liabilities. The following table shows the changes in contract liability balances relating to prepaid supply agreements during the first six months of 2018:(In Millions)  Prepaid supply agreements balance as of Dec 31, 2017 $105Additions and adjustments 2,723Revenue recognized (124)Prepaid supply agreements balance as of Jun 30, 2018 $2,704Additions in the first six months of 2018 include a $1.0 billion reclassification from customer deposits previously included in other long-term liabilities.

In the second quarter of 2018, we completed the divestiture of Wind River Systems, Inc. and recognized a pre-tax gain of $494 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we have settled conversion requests for our 2039 convertible debentures totaling $476 million in principal, resulting in a cumulative loss of $130 million.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements12Table of ContentsNOTE 7: INCOME TAXES During the second quarter of 2018, we adjusted our provisional tax estimates related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the impact of additional analysis related to the transition tax liability. Our accounting remains incomplete as of the second quarter of 2018 and will be refined throughout 2018 based on our ongoing analysis of data and tax positions along with new guidance from regulators and interpretation of the law. Our estimated annual effective tax rate for the first six months of 2018 includes provisional tax estimates for certain Tax Reform provisions related to foreign-derived intangible income and low-taxed intangible income. We expect that these provisions will be clarified by additional analysis and regulatory guidance, and the clarification could impact our estimated annual effective tax rate. Our effective income tax rate was 10.2% in the first six months of 2018 compared to 31.2% in the first six months of 2017. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate in the first six months of 2018 by approximately eight percentage points. Further, the Tax Reform provisions related to foreign-derived intangible income favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately three percentage points, and the provision related to low-taxed intangible income and the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction each unfavorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately one percentage point. The decrease in the first six months of 2018 was also driven by one-time items, primarily associated with the $822 million tax expense in the second quarter of 2017 due to our divestiture of ISecG, which increased our effective tax rate in the first six months of 2017 by approximately nine percentage points, and the adjustment to our provisional estimates for Tax Reform in the first six months of 2018, which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points.

On April 28, 2017, Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera) completed its initial public offering and we designated our previous equity and cost method investments in Cloudera as available-for-sale. During the second quarter of 2017, we determined we had an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of our investment and recognized an impairment charge of $278 million. Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel® architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones. We agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd., a holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup. During 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment and accounted for our interest using the cost method of accounting. During 2017, we reduced our expectation of the company's future operating performance due to competitive pressures, which resulted in an impairment charge of $308 million.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements14Table of ContentsIM Flash Technologies, LLCIMFT was formed in 2006 by Micron and Intel to jointly develop NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint™ technology products. On July 16, 2018, Intel and Micron announced that they agreed to complete joint development for the second generation of 3D XPoint technology, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2019. Technology development beyond the second generation of 3D XPoint technology will be pursued independently by the two companies in order to optimize the technology for their respective product and business needs. Intel continues to purchase jointly developed products from Micron under certain supply agreements.    As of June 30, 2018, we own a 49% interest in IMFT. The carrying value of our investment was $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2018 ($1.5 billion as of December 30, 2017), which is classified as an equity method investment.The IMFT operating agreement continues through 2024 unless terminated earlier, and provides for certain buy-sell rights of the joint venture. Intel has the right to cause Micron to buy our interest in IMFT and, if exercised, Micron could elect to receive financing from us for one to two years. Commencing in January 2019, Micron has the right to call our interest in IMFT with the closing date to be effective within one year.IMFT is a variable interest entity and all costs of IMFT are passed on to Micron and Intel through sale of products or services in proportional share of ownership. Our portion of IMFT costs was approximately $144 million in the second quarter of 2018 and approximately $227 million in the first six months of 2018 (approximately $105 million in the second quarter of 2017 and approximately $235 million in the first six months of 2017). In the event that IMFT has excess cash, IMFT will make payments to Micron and Intel in the form of dividends. IMFT depends on Micron and Intel for any additional cash needs. During the first six months of 2018, we extended $319 million in member debt financing (MDF) to IMFT to fund the ramp of 3D XPoint technology. The MDF balance may be converted to a capital contribution at our request, or may be repaid upon availability of funds. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in IMFT. Our potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of IMFT and future cash calls. In addition, because we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFT’s production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value.We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity and therefore, we account for our interest in IMFT using the equity method of accounting.

If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASISFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities (that have not been re-measured or impaired in the current period), grants receivable, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements and our short-term and long-term debt.Prior to the adoption of the new financial instrument standard, our non-marketable cost method investments were disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis and the carrying amount and fair value as of December 30, 2017 was $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. These assets were classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs. As of June 30, 2018, the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable, loans receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements was $996 million (the aggregate carrying amount as of December 30, 2017 was $935 million). The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value and is categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.As of June 30, 2018, the fair value of short and long-term debt (excluding drafts payable) was $29.5 billion (the fair value as of December 30, 2017 was $29.4 billion). These liabilities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.

Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.European Commission Competition MatterIn 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged "conditional rebates and payments" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged "payments to prevent sales of specific rival products." The EC imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to "immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in" the EC decision.The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should "cease and desist" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements24Table of ContentsWe appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intel’s grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court has appointed a panel of five judges to consider our appeal of the EC’s 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice’s clarifications of the law. In November 2017, the parties filed initial “Observations” about the Court of Justice’s decision and the appeal, and were invited by the General Court to offer supplemental comments to each other’s “Observations,” which the parties submitted in March 2018. Pending the final decision in this matter, the fine paid by Intel has been placed by the EC in commercial bank accounts where it accrues interest.Shareholder Derivative Litigation regarding In re High Tech Employee Antitrust LitigationIn March 2014, the Police Retirement System of St. Louis (PRSSL) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and former officers. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duties to the company by participating in, or allowing, purported antitrust violations that were alleged in a now-settled antitrust class action lawsuit captioned In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation claiming that Intel, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Google Inc., Intuit Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd., and Pixar conspired to suppress their employees’ compensation. In March 2014, a second plaintiff, Barbara Templeton, filed a substantially similar derivative suit in the same court. In May 2014, a third shareholder, Robert Achermann, filed a substantially similar derivative action in the same court. The court consolidated the three actions into one, which is captioned In re Intel Corporation Shareholder Derivative Litigation. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in July 2014. In August 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion for new trial, both of which the court denied in October 2015. In November 2015, plaintiffs PRSSL and Templeton appealed the court's decision. The appeal is fully briefed, and we are waiting on a hearing date from the appellate court.In June 2015, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Chancery Court in Delaware against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and former officers. The lawsuit makes allegations substantially similar to those in the California shareholder derivative litigation described above, but additionally alleges breach of the duty of disclosure with respect to In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation and that Intel's 2013 and 2014 proxy statements misrepresented the effectiveness of the Board’s oversight of compliance issues at Intel and the Board’s compliance with Intel’s Code of Conduct and Board of Director Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues. In October 2015, the court stayed the IBEW lawsuit for six months pending further developments in the California case. In March 2016, Intel and IBEW entered into a stipulated dismissal pursuant to which IBEW dismissed its complaint but may re-file upon the withdrawal or final resolution of the appeal in the PRSSL California shareholder derivative litigation.In April 2016, John Esposito filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel, current members of our Board of Directors, and certain former officers and employees. Esposito made a demand on our Board in 2013 to investigate whether our officers or directors should be sued for their participation in the events described in In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation. In November 2015, our Board decided not to take further action on Esposito’s demand based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Board after its investigation of relevant facts and circumstances. Esposito seeks to set aside such decision, and alleges that the Board was not disinterested in making that decision and that the investigation was inadequate. In November 2016, the court granted Intel’s motion to dismiss the case, without leave to amend. In March 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for fees. The court denied plaintiff’s fee motion in May 2017, and entered final judgment in this matter in June 2017. In August 2017, Esposito appealed the final judgment but withdrew the appeal in June 2018, ending the case.McAfee, Inc. Shareholder LitigationOn August 19, 2010, we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of the common stock of McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) for $48.00 per share. Four McAfee shareholders filed putative class-action lawsuits in Santa Clara County, California Superior Court challenging the proposed transaction. The cases were ordered consolidated in September 2010. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named former McAfee board members, McAfee, and Intel as defendants, and alleged that the McAfee board members breached their fiduciary duties and that McAfee and Intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty. The complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement, such other equitable relief as the court may deem proper, and an award of damages in an unspecified amount. In June 2012, the plaintiffs’ damages expert asserted that the value of a McAfee share for the purposes of assessing damages should be $62.08.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements25Table of ContentsIn January 2012, the court certified the action as a class action, appointed the Central Pension Laborers’ Fund to act as the class representative, and scheduled trial to begin in January 2013. In March 2012, defendants filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order; the petition was denied in June 2012. In March 2012, at defendants’ request, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial and ordered a bench trial. In April 2012, plaintiffs filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order, which the court of appeal denied in July 2012. In August 2012, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted that motion in November 2012, and entered final judgment in the case in February 2013. In April 2013, plaintiffs appealed the final judgment. The California Court of Appeal heard oral argument in October 2017, and in November 2017, affirmed the judgment as to McAfee's nine outside directors, reversed the judgment as to former McAfee director and chief executive officer David DeWalt, Intel, and McAfee, and affirmed the trial court's ruling that the plaintiffs are not entitled to a jury trial. At a June 2018 case management conference following remand, the Superior Court set an October hearing date for any additional summary judgment motions that may be filed, and set trial to begin in December 2018. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint which is set for hearing in September 2018. Because the resolution of pretrial motions may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, and because of uncertainties regarding theories that may be asserted at trial following the appellate court's remand of only certain claims in the proceeding and the extent of Intel's responsibility, if any, with respect to such claims, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.Litigation related to Security VulnerabilitiesIn June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown”) that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our executives and directors, in U.S. federal and state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities.As of July 25, 2018, 46 consumer class action lawsuits and three securities class action lawsuits have been filed. The consumer class action plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of end users of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. Of the consumer class action lawsuits, 42 have been filed in the United States, two in Canada, and two in Israel. In April 2018, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the U.S. consumer class action lawsuits consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. The lead securities class action plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 27, 2017 and January 9, 2018, generally allege that Intel and certain officers violated securities laws by making statements about Intel's products that were revealed to be false or misleading by the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities. The securities class actions are pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted on behalf of customers and shareholders seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.In addition to these lawsuits, Intel stockholders have filed seven shareholder derivative lawsuits since January 2018 against certain current and former members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former officers, alleging that the defendants breached their duties to Intel in connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. The complaints seek to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. Three of the derivative actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and have been consolidated. Defendants moved to dismiss those actions on the ground that plaintiffs’ failure to make a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board was not excused. The hearing on that motion is scheduled for August 2018. Four of the derivative actions were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California in San Mateo County and have been consolidated. Defendants moved to stay the state court derivative actions pending resolution of the federal derivative actions and also moved to dismiss the state court actions on the ground that plaintiffs’ failure to make a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board was not excused. The hearing on the motion to stay is scheduled for early August 2018, and the hearing on the motion to dismiss is scheduled for late August 2018.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements26Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) - RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAfter five decades in the tech industry, we are poised to deliver another record year, our third in a row. We had record second quarter revenue and are continuing to transform the company from a PC-centric to a data-centric company. Our data-centric businesses collectively grew 26% from a year ago and are now approaching 50% of our revenue. Individually, Data Center Group (DCG), Internet of Things Group (IOTG), Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG), and Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) all achieved double digit revenue growth. Client Computing Group (CCG) continued to execute well, producing 6% revenue growth and funding data-centric investments. Strong operating margin leverage and our lower tax rate resulted in GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth, even as we continued investing in growth areas. For a more comprehensive overview of the results of our operations, see "A Quarter in Review."   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended  Q2 2018 Q2 2017 YTD 2018 YTD 2017(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenueNet revenue $16,962 100.0 % $14,763 100.0% $33,028 100.0% $29,559 100.0%Cost of sales 6,543 38.6 % 5,667 38.4% 12,878 39.0% 11,303 38.2%Gross margin 10,419 61.4 % 9,096 61.6% 20,150 61.0% 18,256 61.8%Research and development 3,371 19.9 % 3,262 22.1% 6,682 20.2% 6,573 22.2%Marketing, general and administrative 1,725 10.2 % 1,850 12.5% 3,625 11.0% 3,949 13.4%Restructuring and other charges — — % 105 0.7% — —% 185 0.6%Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 50 0.3 % 37 0.3% 100 0.3% 75 0.3%Operating income 5,273 31.1 % 3,842 26.0% 9,743 29.5% 7,474 25.3%Gains (losses) on equity investments, net (203) (1.2)% 342 2.3% 440 1.3% 594 2.0%Interest and other, net 459 2.7 % 388 2.6% 357 1.1% 319 1.1%Income before taxes 5,529 32.6 % 4,572 31.0% 10,540 31.9% 8,387 28.4%Provision for taxes 523 3.1 % 1,764 11.9% 1,080 3.3% 2,615 8.8%Net income $5,006 29.5 % $2,808 19.0% $9,460 28.6% $5,772 19.5%                 Earnings per share – Diluted $1.05   $0.58   $1.98   $1.19  MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Results & Analysis27Table of ContentsREVENUE(Dollars in charts are shown in billions) SEGMENT REVENUE WALKS Q2 2018 vs. Q2 2017 YTD 2018 vs. YTD 2017Q2 2018 vs. Q2 2017Our Q2 2018 revenue was $17.0 billion, up $2.2 billion, or 15%, from Q2 2017. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by strong performance across our data-centric businesses, which collectively grew 26% year over year. Mobileye, which we acquired in Q3 2017, recognized $173 million in revenue, contributing to the growth of our data-centric businesses. Our PC-centric business also grew 6%.

We are executing to our strategy of growing data-centric businesses, which collectively grew revenue by 20% in the first half of 2018 compared to first half of 2017. Our recently acquired Mobileye business recognized $324 million in revenue, contributing to the growth of our data-centric businesses. Data-centric businesses in YTD 2017 included $534 million in revenue from Intel Security Group (ISecG), which we divested in Q2 2017. Our PC-centric business also grew 5%. GROSS MARGIN(Dollars in chart are shown in billions; percentages indicate gross margin as a percentage of total revenue) GROSS MARGIN    We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars from the sale of platform products in the CCG and DCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in Q2 2018 increased by $1.3 billion compared to Q2 2017. Our gross margin percentage was slightly down as the increase in higher platform revenue was offset by higher unit costs as well as a higher proportion of our revenue from lower margin adjacent businesses.MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Results & Analysis28Table of Contents(In Millions) Gross Margin Walk$10,419 Q2 2018 Gross Margin1,550 Higher gross margin from platform revenue150 Higher gross margin from adjacent businesses120 Lower factory start-up costs, primarily associated with our 10nm process technology(350) Higher platform unit costs, primarily from mix of products(125) Period charges primarily associated with engineering samples and higher initial production costs from our 10nm products(22) Other$9,096 Q2 2017 Gross Margin   $20,150 YTD 2018 Gross Margin2,695 Higher gross margin from platform revenue360 Lower factory start-up costs, primarily associated with our 10nm process technology(435) Higher platform unit cost, primarily from mix of products(395) Period charges primarily associated with engineering samples and higher initial production costs from our 10nm products(295) Impact of ISecG divestiture offset by higher gross margin from adjacent businesses(36) Other$18,256 YTD 2017 Gross MarginMD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Results & Analysis29Table of ContentsOPERATING EXPENSES(Dollars in charts are shown in billions; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of total revenue) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVETotal research and development (R&D) and marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) expenses for Q2 2018 were $5.1 billion, flat from Q2 2017 (down 2.0% on a YTD basis).

The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) reduced the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% and the decrease in effective tax rate was also driven by one-time items, primarily associated with the $822 million tax expense in Q2 2017 due to our divestiture of ISecG, which increased our Q2 2017 effective tax rate by 16 percentage points, and the adjustment to our provisional estimates for Tax Reform in Q2 2018, which reduced our effective income tax rate by three percentage points.Our effective income tax rate was 10.2% in the first six months of 2018 compared to 31.2% in the first six months of 2017. The reduction in the U.S statutory federal tax rate favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately eight percentage points. Further, the Tax Reform provisions related to foreign-derived intangible income favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately three percentage points, and the provision related to low-taxed intangible income and the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction each unfavorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately one percentage point. The decrease was also driven by one-time items, primarily associated with the $822 million tax expense in Q2 2017 due to our divestiture of ISecG, which increased our effective tax rate in the first six months of 2017 by approximately nine percentage points, and the adjustment to our provisional estimates for Tax Reform in the first six months of 2018, which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points.

Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Below, we have updated the risk factor included in our 2017 Form 10-K titled “We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks—Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure.” The Risk Factors section in our 2017 Form 10-K otherwise remains current in all material respects.Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our IT systems. Additionally, individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers or intruders into our physical facilities, may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or updates to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products as well as the operating systems and workloads running on them. For example, a type of security vulnerability known as a side-channel exploit has been identified. Side-channel exploits include the variants referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown.” Additional variants have been identified and may continue to be identified. As we have become a more data-centric company, our processors and other products are being used in more and different critical application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks. In addition, publicity about security vulnerabilities and attempted or successful exploits, whether accurate or inaccurate, may result in increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Although vulnerabilities have often been discovered and mitigated in advance of being exploited, it is possible that vulnerabilities may not be mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products may not promptly learn of or be able to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information could develop which changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters. Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, may not be available on a timely basis, or at all, may not operate as intended, or may not effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we may be required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques may depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether and how to develop and deploy mitigations. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques may result in adverse performance effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, or the misappropriation of data by third parties.  OTHER KEY INFORMATION 39Table of ContentsSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not they involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties may release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. For example, information on the “Spectre” and “Meltdown” side-channel variants was prematurely reported publicly before mitigation techniques to address all vulnerabilities were made widely available, and certain of the mitigation techniques did not operate as intended. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe believe non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. Our non-GAAP operating income and diluted earnings per share reflect adjustments for the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Acquisition-related adjustments: The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company exclude certain expenses related to acquisitions. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. We record charges related to the amortization of these intangibles within both cost of sales and operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.OTHER KEY INFORMATION 40Table of ContentsRestructuring and other charges:Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include asset impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with the ISecG divestiture. We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these costs do not reflect our current operating performance. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. Ongoing mark to market on marketable equity securities:We exclude gains and losses resulting from ongoing mark to market adjustments of our marketable equity securities when calculating certain non-GAAP measures as we do not believe this volatility correlates to our core operational performance. Consequently, our non-GAAP earnings per share figures exclude these impacts to facilitate an evaluation of our current performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.Gains or losses from divestitures:We divested ISecG in Q2 2017 and Wind River in Q2 2018. We exclude gains or losses, and related tax impacts, resulting from divestitures when calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.Tax Reform adjustment: During Q2 2018, we made an adjustment to our Tax Reform provisional tax estimates that we recorded in Q4 2017. We exclude this provisional tax adjustment when calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe making this adjustment facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.Following are the reconciliations of our most comparable GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:  Three Months Ended(In Millions) Jun 30, 2018 Jul 1, 2017Operating income $5,273 $3,842Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 325 235Restructuring and other charges — 105Non-GAAP operating income $5,598 $4,182  Three Months Ended  Jun 30, 2018 Jul 1, 2017Earnings per share - Diluted $1.05 $0.58Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 0.07 0.05Restructuring and other charges — 0.02Ongoing mark to market on marketable equity securities  0.05 —(Gains) losses from divestitures (0.10) (0.08)Tax Reform (0.04) —Income tax effect 0.01 0.15Non-GAAP Earnings per share - Diluted $1.04 $0.72OTHER KEY INFORMATION 41Table of ContentsISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESWe have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. As of June 30, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase up to $75.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.Common stock repurchase activity under our publicly announced stock repurchase plan during the second quarter of 2018 was as follows:Period Total Numberof SharesPurchased(In Millions) Average PricePaid Per Share Dollar Value ofShares That MayYet Be PurchasedUnder the Plans(In Millions)April 1, 2018 - April 28, 2018 12.9 $50.97 $10,577April 29, 2018 - May 26, 2018 13.6 $54.16 $9,840May 27, 2018 - June 30, 2018 49.3 $53.02 $7,224Total 75.9 $52.87   We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our consolidated condensed financial statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan and accordingly are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the preceding table.OTHER KEY INFORMATION 42Table of ContentsEXHIBITS    Incorporated by Reference  ExhibitNumber Exhibit Description Form File Number Exhibit FilingDate Filed orFurnishedHerewith3.1 Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Intel Corporation dated May 17, 2006 8-K 000-06217 3.1 5/22/2006  3.2 Intel Corporation Bylaws, as amended and restated on March 14, 2018 8-K 000-06217 3.2 3/19/2018  12.1 Statement Setting Forth the Computation of Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges         X31.1 Certification of interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)         X32.1 Certification of the interim Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(b) of the Exchange Act and 18 U.S.C.
