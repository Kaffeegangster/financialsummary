Our transformation to a data-centric company accelerated with the revenue of our data-centric businesses up 25% over the first quarter of last year excluding Intel Security Group (ISecG). Collectively, these businesses now account for 49% of revenue and are on track to cross over 50% of revenue this year — an important milestone for our company. CCG continued to execute well, producing revenue growth within a declining PC market.  We generated $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders. We received prepayments of $1.7 billion associated with NAND strategic customer supply agreements.REVENUE OPERATING INCOME DILUTED EPS$16.1B   $4.5B $4.8B $0.93 $0.87GAAP   GAAP non-GAAP1 GAAP non-GAAP1up $1.3B or 9% from Q1 2017; up 13% excluding ISecG up $838M or 23% from Q1 2017 up $836M or 21% from Q1 2017 up $0.32 or 53% from Q1 2017 up $0.21 or 32% from Q1 2017         Strong results from data-centric businesses driven by double-digit growth across DCG, IOTG, NSG, and PSG Higher ASP and volume with lower spending, offset by 10nm transition costs Data-centric growth, strong operating margin leverage, lower tax rate from Tax Reform2, and mark to market gains in GAAP results           ■ Data-centric $B ■ PC-centric $B ■ GAAP $B ■ Non-GAAP $B ■ GAAP ■ Non-GAAP  BUSINESS SUMMARY•Data-centric investments are building momentum. Customers are accelerating adoption of Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and our field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are winning data-center designs. •We announced new products including the high performance 8th Gen Intel® Core™ i9 processor for mobile and the Intel® Optane™ SSD 800P, the latest addition to the growing Intel Optane technology family of products. •Mobileye won a high-volume design for EyeQ*5. We also began operating autonomous vehicle test cars in Israel with plans to expand the fleet to other geographies.•We are sharpening the focus of IOTG toward growth opportunities that align to our data-centric strategy. We entered into an agreement to divest Wind River Systems, Inc. (Wind River), currently reported under IOTG. The assets and liabilities of Wind River are classified as held for sale and we expect the transaction to close by the end of Q2 this year. •We continue to make 14nm process optimizations and architectural innovations in both data-center and client products that will be coming this year. Intel is currently shipping low volume 10nm product and now expects 10nm volume production to shift to 2019.•The security of our products is one of our most important priorities. We have released microcode updates for Intel products launched in the past nine years that require protection against the side-channel method vulnerabilities referred to as "Spectre" and "Meltdown." In addition, we are making changes to our future hardware design to address certain of these side-channel variants. 1 See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within Other Key Information.2 Tax Reform refers to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.A QUARTER IN REVIEW 2Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSPageConsolidated Condensed Statements of Income4Consolidated Condensed Statements of Comprehensive Income5Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets6Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows7  Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements8  Basis Note 1: Basis of Presentation8Note 2: Recent Accounting Standards and Accounting Policies8Performance & Operations Note 3: Operating Segments11Note 4: Earnings Per Share13Note 5: Contract Liabilities14Note 6: Other Financial Statement Details14Note 7: Income Taxes15Investments, Long-term Assets & Debt Note 8: Investments15Note 9: Identified Intangible Assets17Note 10: Other Long-Term Assets18Note 11: Fair Value19Risk Management & Other Note 12: Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)20Note 13: Derivative Financial Instruments22Note 14: Employee Equity Incentive Plans24Note 15: Contingencies25  3Table of ContentsINTEL CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF INCOME   Three Months Ended(In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts; Unaudited) Mar 31, 2018 Apr 1, 2017Net revenue $16,066 $14,796Cost of sales 6,335 5,636Gross margin 9,731 9,160Research and development 3,311 3,311Marketing, general and administrative 1,900 2,099Restructuring and other charges — 80Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 50 38Operating expenses 5,261 5,528Operating income 4,470 3,632Gains (losses) on equity investments, net 643 252Interest and other, net (102) (69)Income before taxes 5,011 3,815Provision for taxes 557 851Net income $4,454 $2,964Earnings per share – Basic $0.95 $0.63Earnings per share – Diluted $0.93 $0.61Cash dividends declared per share of common stock $0.60 $0.5325Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding:    Basic 4,674 4,723Diluted 4,790 4,881See accompanying notes.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income4Table of ContentsINTEL CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  Three Months Ended(In Millions; Unaudited) Mar 31, 2018 Apr 1, 2017Net income $4,454 $2,964Changes in other comprehensive income, net of tax:    Net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale equity investments — 543Net unrealized holding gains (losses) on derivatives 119 195Actuarial valuation and other pension benefits (expenses), net 148 18Translation adjustments and other (22) 1Other comprehensive income (loss) 245 757Total comprehensive income $4,699 $3,721See accompanying notes.

The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 Form 10-K. NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIESWe assess the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on our financial statements. The sections below describe impacts from newly adopted standards as well as material updates to our previous assessments, if any, from our 2017 Form 10-K. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTEDCompensation - Retirement Benefits - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit CostStandard/Description: This amended standard was issued to provide additional guidance on the presentation of net periodic benefit cost in the income statement and on the components eligible for capitalization in assets. In accordance with the revised standard, we have separated the different components of net periodic benefit cost, presenting service cost components within operating income and other non-service components separately outside of operating income on the income statement. In addition, only service costs are now eligible for inventory capitalization.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2018. Changes to the presentation of benefit costs were required to be adopted retrospectively, while changes to the capitalization of service costs into inventories are required to be adopted prospectively. The standard permits, as a practical expedient, use of the amounts disclosed in the Retirement Benefit Plans footnote for the prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirement.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Adoption of the amended standard resulted in the reclassification of approximately $114 million of non-service net periodic benefit costs from line items within operating income to interest and other, net, for the year ended December 30, 2017 ($259 million for the year ended December 31, 2016). Revenue Recognition - Contracts with CustomersStandard/Description: This standard was issued to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by all companies. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2018.This standard was adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Our adoption assessments identified a change in revenue recognition timing on our component sales made to distributors. Under the new standard we now recognize revenue when we deliver to the distributor rather than deferring recognition until the distributor sells the components. On the date of initial application, we removed the deferred income and related receivables on component sales made to distributors through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. The revenue deferral that was historically recognized in the following period is expected to be primarily offset by the acceleration of revenue recognition in the current period as control of the product transfers to our customer.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements8Table of ContentsOur assessment also identified a change in expense recognition timing related to payments we make to our customers for distinct services they perform as part of cooperative advertising programs, which were previously recorded as operating expenses. We now recognize the expense for cooperative advertising in the period the marketing activities occur. Previously we recognized the expense in the period the customer was entitled to participate in the program, which coincided with the period of sale. On the date of initial adoption, we capitalized the expense of cooperative advertising not performed through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. We have completed our adoption and implemented policies, processes, and controls to support the standard's measurement and disclosure requirements. Refer to the tables below, which summarize the impacts of the changes discussed above to Intel's financial statements recorded as an adjustment to opening balances for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017, and also provide comparative reporting of the impacts of adopting the standard.Accounting Policy Updates: We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales.We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Any variable consideration is recognized as a reduction of net revenue at the time of revenue recognition. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. The impacts of distributor sales price reductions resulting from price protection agreements are also estimated based on historical analysis of such activity and are reflected as a reduction in net revenue. We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs, such as our Intel Inside® program, for marketing activities for certain of our products. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs as a reduction in revenue at the same time that the related revenue is recognized.Financial Instruments - Recognition and MeasurementStandard/Description: Requires changes to the accounting for financial instruments that primarily affect equity investments, financial liabilities measured using the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for such instruments.Effective Date and Adoption Considerations: Effective in the first quarter of 2018. Changes to our marketable equity securities were required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017. Since management has elected to apply the measurement alternative to non-marketable equity securities, changes to these securities were adopted prospectively.Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Marketable equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale equity investments are now measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through the income statement.All non-marketable equity securities formerly classified as cost method investments are measured and recorded using the measurement alternative. Equity securities measured and recorded using the measurement alternative are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Adjustments resulting from impairments and observable price changes are recorded in the income statement.Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, in accordance with the standard, recurring fair value disclosures are no longer provided for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative. In addition, the existing impairment model has been replaced with a new one-step qualitative impairment model. No initial adoption adjustment was recorded for these instruments since the standard is required to be applied prospectively for securities measured using the measurement alternative.We have completed our adoption and implemented policies, processes, and controls to support the standard's measurement and disclosure requirements. Refer to the table below, which summarizes impacts, net of tax, of the changes discussed above to Intel's financial statements. This reflects an adjustment to opening balances for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017. Accounting Policy Updates: We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:•Marketable equity securities are equity securities with readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value. Prior to fiscal 2018, these securities were measured and recorded at fair value and classified as available-for-sale securities. •Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative which measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. These securities were previously accounted for using the cost method of accounting, measured at cost less other-than-temporary impairment. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements9Table of Contents•Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag and is recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.  Realized and unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in value and sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. We previously recorded unrealized gains and losses through other comprehensive income (loss) and realized gains and losses on the sale, exchange or impairment of these equity investments through gains (losses) on equity investments, net.The carrying value of our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities totaled $2.8 billion as of March 31, 2018 ($2.6 billion as of December 30, 2017). The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include industry and market conditions, the financial performance and near-term prospects of the investee, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our equity investments using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. Prior to fiscal 2018, non-marketable equity securities were tested for impairment using the other-than-temporary impairment model which considered the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. Impairments of non-marketable equity securities were $16 million in the first quarter of 2018 ($46 million in the first quarter of 2017).Opening Balance AdjustmentsThe following table summarizes the effects of adopting Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Customers, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement, and other accounting standards on our financial statements for the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017 as an adjustment to the opening balance:    Adjustments from  (In Millions) Balance as ofDec 30, 2017 Revenue Standard Financial Instruments Update Other1  Opening Balance as ofDec 31, 2017Assets:          Accounts receivable $5,607 $(530) $— $— $5,077Inventories $6,983 $47 $— $— $7,030Other current assets $2,908 $64 $— $(8) $2,964Equity investments $— $— $8,579 $— $8,579Marketable equity securities $4,192 $— $(4,192) $— $—Other long-term assets $7,602 $— $(4,387) $(43) $3,172           Liabilities:          Deferred income $1,656 $(1,356) $— $— $300Other accrued liabilities $7,535 $81 $— $— $7,616Deferred income taxes $3,046 $191 $— $(20) $3,217           Stockholders' equity:          Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $862 $— $(1,745) $(45) $(928)Retained earnings $42,083 $665 $1,745 $14 $44,5071 Includes adjustments from adoption of "Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory" and "Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income - Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements10Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the impacts of adopting the new revenue standard on our consolidated condensed statement of income and balance sheet:  For the period ended March 31, 2018(In Millions) As reported Adjustments Without new revenue standardIncome Statement             Net revenue $16,066 $(462) $15,604Cost of sales 6,335 (156) 6,179Gross margin 9,731 (306) 9,425Marketing, general and administrative 1,900 (52) 1,848Operating income 4,470 (254) 4,216Income before taxes 5,011 (254) 4,757Provision for taxes 557 (47) 510Net income $4,454 $(207) $4,247       Balance Sheet             Assets:      Accounts receivable $4,879 $346 $5,225Inventories $7,146 $51 $7,197Other current assets $3,408 $(14) $3,394       Liabilities:      Deferred income $— $1,670 $1,670Other accrued liabilities $9,586 $(181) $9,405Deferred income taxes $1,564 $(229) $1,335       Equity:      Retained earnings $44,418 $(877) $43,541NOTE 3: OPERATING SEGMENTS We manage our business through the following operating segments:•Client Computing Group (CCG)•Data Center Group (DCG)•Internet of Things Group (IOTG)•Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG)•Programmable Solutions Group (PSG)•All OtherWe offer platform products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone System-on-Chip (SoC), or a multichip package. A platform product may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services offered by Intel. Platform products are used in various form factors across our CCG, DCG, and IOTG operating segments. We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products, which are our principal products and considered as one class of product. CCG and DCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. The “all other” category includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:•results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, including Mobileye results;•historical results of operations from divested businesses; •results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business;   •amounts included within restructuring and other charges;  •a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and •acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements11Table of ContentsThe Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), which is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except for these differences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.Net revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:  Three Months Ended(In Millions) Mar 31, 2018 Apr 1, 2017Net revenue:    Client Computing Group    Platform $7,615 $7,397Adjacent 605 579  8,220 7,976Data Center Group    Platform 4,824 3,879Adjacent 410 353  5,234 4,232Internet of Things Group    Platform 719 632Adjacent 121 89  840 721Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group 1,040 866Programmable Solutions Group 498 425All other 234 576Total net revenue $16,066 $14,796     Operating income (loss):    Client Computing Group $2,791 $3,031Data Center Group 2,602 1,487Internet of Things Group 227 105Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (81) (129)Programmable Solutions Group 97 92All other (1,166) (954)Total operating income $4,470 $3,632FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements12Table of ContentsDisaggregated net revenue for each period was as follows:  Three Months Ended(In Millions) Mar 31, 2018 Apr 1, 2017Platform revenue    Desktop platform $2,907 $2,855Notebook platform 4,689 4,498DCG platform 4,824 3,879Other platform1 738 676  13,158 11,908     Adjacent revenue2 2,908 2,354ISecG divested business — 534Total revenue $16,066 $14,7961 Includes our tablet, service provider, and IOTG platform revenue.2 Includes all of our non-platform products for CCG, DCG, and IOTG like modem, ethernet, and silicon photonic, as well as NSG, PSG, and Mobileye products.NOTE 4: EARNINGS PER SHARE We computed basic earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period.   Three Months Ended(In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Mar 31, 2018 Apr 1, 2017Net income available to common stockholders $4,454 $2,964Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding – basic 4,674 4,723Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans 65 58Dilutive effect of convertible debt 51 100Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding – diluted 4,790 4,881Earnings per share – Basic $0.95 $0.63Earnings per share – Diluted $0.93 $0.61 Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs), and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. In December 2017, we paid cash to satisfy the conversion of our 2035 debentures, which we excluded from our dilutive earnings per share computation starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and are no longer dilutive. Our 2039 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion. Since the conversion premium is paid in cash or stock at our option, we determined the potentially dilutive shares of common stock by applying the treasury stock method. In all periods presented, potentially dilutive securities which would have been antidilutive are insignificant and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. In all periods presented, we included our 2039 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because the average market price was above the conversion price. We could potentially exclude the 2039 debentures in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements13Table of ContentsNOTE 5: CONTRACT LIABILITIES(In Millions) Mar 31, 2018 Opening Balance as of Dec 31, 2017Contract liabilities from prepaid supply agreements $2,723 $105Contract liabilities from software, services and other 115 195Total contract liabilities $2,838 $300Contract liabilities are primarily related to partial prepayments received from customers on long term supply agreements towards future NSG product delivery.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements14Table of ContentsNOTE 7: INCOME TAXES We have not adjusted our provisional tax estimates related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our accounting remains incomplete as of the first three months of 2018 and will be refined throughout 2018 based on our ongoing analysis of data and tax positions along with new guidance from regulators and interpretation of the law. Our estimated annual effective tax rate for the first three months of 2018 includes provisional tax estimates for certain Tax Reform provisions related to foreign-derived intangible income and low-taxed intangible income. We expect that these provisions will be clarified by additional analysis and regulatory guidance, and the clarification could impact our estimated annual effective tax rate. Our effective income tax rate was 11.1% in the first three months of 2018 compared to 22.3% in the first three months of 2017. The reduction from Tax Reform of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately nine percentage points. Further, the new Tax Reform provisions related to foreign-derived intangible income favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points, and the provision related to low-taxed intangible income and the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction each unfavorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately one percentage point. In addition, our effective tax rate in the first three months of 2018 was favorably impacted by one-time items unrelated to Tax Reform.

On April 28, 2017, Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera) completed its initial public offering and we designated our previous equity and cost method investments in Cloudera as available-for-sale. During the second quarter of 2017, we determined we had an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of our investment and recognized an impairment charge of $278 million. Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel® architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones. We agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd., a holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup. During 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment and accounted for our interest using the cost method of accounting. During 2017, we reduced our expectation of the company's future operating performance due to competitive pressures, which resulted in an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $308 million.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements16Table of ContentsIM Flash Technologies, LLCSince the inception of IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) in 2006, Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) and Intel have jointly developed NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint™ technology products. Intel also purchases jointly developed products directly from Micron under certain supply agreements.As of March 31, 2018, we own a 49% interest in IMFT. The carrying value of our investment was $1.8 billion as of March 31, 2018 ($1.5 billion as of December 30, 2017) which is classified as an equity method investment.The IMFT operating agreement continues through 2024 unless terminated earlier, and provides for certain buy-sell rights of the joint venture. Intel has the right to cause Micron to buy our interest in IMFT and, if exercised, Micron could elect to receive financing from us for one to two years. Commencing in January 2019, Micron has the right to call our interest in IMFT with the closing date to be effective within one year.IMFT is a variable interest entity and all costs of IMFT are passed on to Micron and Intel through sale of products or services in proportional share of ownership. Our portion of IMFT costs was approximately $83 million in the first three months of 2018 (approximately $130 million in the first three months of 2017). In the event that IMFT has excess cash, IMFT will make payments to Micron and Intel in the form of dividends.IMFT depends on Micron and Intel for any additional cash needs. During the first quarter of 2018, we extended $319 million in member debt financing (MDF) to IMFT to fund the ramp of 3D XPoint technology. The MDF balance may be converted to a capital contribution at our request, or may be repaid upon availability of funds. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in IMFT. Our potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of IMFT and future cash calls. In addition, because we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFT’s production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value.We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity, and therefore, we account for our interest in IMFT using the equity method of accounting.NOTE 9: IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS   March 31, 2018(In Millions) Gross Assets AccumulatedAmortization NetAcquisition-related developed

ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASISOur non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period we classify these assets as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASISFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities (that have not been re-measured or impaired in the current period), grants receivable, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements and our short-term and long-term debt.Prior to the adoption of the new financial instrument standard, our non-marketable cost method investments were not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and the carrying amount and fair value as of December 30, 2017 was $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. These assets were classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs. As of March 31, 2018, the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable, loans receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements was $815 million (the aggregate carrying amount as of December 30, 2017 was $935 million). The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value and is categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.As of March 31, 2018, the fair value of short and long-term debt (excluding drafts payable) was $30.3 billion (the fair value as of December 30, 2017 was $29.4 billion). These liabilities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.

Our plans include our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. The 2006 Equity Incentive Plan had 208 million shares of common stock available through June 2020 for future grants.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONShare-based compensation expense recognized was $433 million in the first three months of 2018 ($397 million in the first three months of 2017).FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements24Table of ContentsRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDSRestricted stock unit activity in the first three months of 2018 was as follows:   Number ofRSUs(In Millions) Weighted AverageGrant-DateFair ValueDecember 30, 2017 100.4 $32.36Granted 8.1 $49.03Vested (4.0) $39.18Forfeited (1.8) $32.09March 31, 2018 102.7 $33.41The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in the first three months of 2018 was $204 million, which represents the market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in first three months of 2018 was $157 million. The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. STOCK PURCHASE PLANThe 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Rights to purchase shares of common stock are granted during the first and third quarters of each year. The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan had 142 million shares of common stock remaining through August 2021 for issuance.Employees purchased 8.2 million shares of common stock in the first three months of 2018 for $249 million (8.0 million shares of common stock in the first three months of 2017 for $235 million) under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan.NOTE 15: CONTINGENCIES LEGAL PROCEEDINGSWe are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.European Commission Competition MatterIn 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged "conditional rebates and payments" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged "payments to prevent sales of specific rival products." The EC imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to "immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in" the EC decision.The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should "cease and desist" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements25Table of ContentsWe appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intel’s grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court has appointed a panel of five judges to consider our appeal of the EC’s 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice’s clarifications of the law. In November 2017, the parties filed initial “Observations” about the Court of Justice’s decision and the appeal, and were invited by the General Court to offer supplemental comments to each other’s “Observations,” which the parties submitted in March 2018. Pending the final decision in this matter, the fine paid by Intel has been placed by the EC in commercial bank accounts where it accrues interest.Shareholder Derivative Litigation regarding In re High Tech Employee Antitrust LitigationIn March 2014, the Police Retirement System of St. Louis (PRSSL) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and former officers. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duties to the company by participating in, or allowing, purported antitrust violations that were alleged in a now-settled antitrust class action lawsuit captioned In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation claiming that Intel, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Google Inc., Intuit Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd., and Pixar conspired to suppress their employees’ compensation. In March 2014, a second plaintiff, Barbara Templeton, filed a substantially similar derivative suit in the same court. In May 2014, a third shareholder, Robert Achermann, filed a substantially similar derivative action in the same court. The court consolidated the three actions into one, which is captioned In re Intel Corporation Shareholder Derivative Litigation. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in July 2014. In August 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion for new trial, both of which the court denied in October 2015. In November 2015, plaintiffs PRSSL and Templeton appealed the court's decision. The appeal is fully briefed, and we are waiting on a hearing date from the appellate court.In June 2015, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Chancery Court in Delaware against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and former officers. The lawsuit makes allegations substantially similar to those in the California shareholder derivative litigation described above, but additionally alleges breach of the duty of disclosure with respect to In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation and that Intel's 2013 and 2014 proxy statements misrepresented the effectiveness of the Board’s oversight of compliance issues at Intel and the Board’s compliance with Intel’s Code of Conduct and Board of Director Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues. In October 2015, the court stayed the IBEW lawsuit for six months pending further developments in the California case. In March 2016, Intel and IBEW entered into a stipulated dismissal pursuant to which IBEW dismissed its complaint but may re-file upon the withdrawal or final resolution of the appeal in the PRSSL California shareholder derivative litigation.In April 2016, John Esposito filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel, current members of our Board of Directors, and certain former officers and employees. Esposito made a demand on our Board in 2013 to investigate whether our officers or directors should be sued for their participation in the events described in In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation. In November 2015, our Board decided not to take further action on Esposito’s demand based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Board after its investigation of relevant facts and circumstances. Esposito seeks to set aside such decision, and alleges that the Board was not disinterested in making that decision and that the investigation was inadequate. In November 2016, the court granted Intel’s motion to dismiss the case, without leave to amend. In March 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for fees. The court denied plaintiff’s fee motion in May 2017, and entered final judgment in this matter in June 2017. In August 2017, Esposito appealed the final judgment.McAfee, Inc. Shareholder LitigationOn August 19, 2010, we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of the common stock of McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) for $48.00 per share. Four McAfee shareholders filed putative class-action lawsuits in Santa Clara County, California Superior Court challenging the proposed transaction. The cases were ordered consolidated in September 2010. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named former McAfee board members, McAfee, and Intel as defendants, and alleged that the McAfee board members breached their fiduciary duties and that McAfee and Intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty. The complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement, such other equitable relief as the court may deem proper, and an award of damages in an unspecified amount. In June 2012, the plaintiffs’ damages expert asserted that the value of a McAfee share for the purposes of assessing damages should be $62.08.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements26Table of ContentsIn January 2012, the court certified the action as a class action, appointed the Central Pension Laborers’ Fund to act as the class representative, and scheduled trial to begin in January 2013. In March 2012, defendants filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order; the petition was denied in June 2012. In March 2012, at defendants’ request, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial and ordered a bench trial. In April 2012, plaintiffs filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order, which the court of appeal denied in July 2012. In August 2012, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted that motion in November 2012, and entered final judgment in the case in February 2013. In April 2013, plaintiffs appealed the final judgment. The California Court of Appeal heard oral argument in October 2017, and in November 2017, affirmed the judgment as to McAfee's nine outside directors, reversed the judgment as to former McAfee director and chief executive officer David DeWalt, Intel, and McAfee, and affirmed the trial court's ruling that the plaintiffs are not entitled to a jury trial. No bench trial date has been set. Because the resolution of pretrial motions may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, and because of uncertainties regarding theories that may be asserted at trial following the appellate court's remand of only certain claims in the proceeding and the extent of Intel's responsibility, if any, with respect to such claims, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.Litigation related to Security VulnerabilitiesIn June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown”) that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our executives and directors, in U.S. federal and state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities.As of April 25, 2018, 42 customer class action lawsuits and three securities class action lawsuits have been filed. The customer class action plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of end users of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. Of the customer class action lawsuits, 39 have been filed in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Israel. In April 2018, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the U.S. customer lawsuits consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. The securities class action plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between July 27, 2017 and January 4, 2018, generally allege that Intel and certain officers violated securities laws by making statements about Intel's products and internal controls that were revealed to be false or misleading by the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted on behalf of customers and shareholders seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.In addition to these lawsuits, Intel stockholders have filed seven shareholder derivative lawsuits against certain members of our Board of Directors and certain officers. In January and April 2018, Joseph Tola, Joanne Bicknese, Michael Kellogg, and Jeffrey Lockwood each filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of the State of California in San Mateo County alleging that the defendants breached their duties to Intel in connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. The complaints seek to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. In March and April 2018, Joseph Lipovich, Martin Salsberg, and Margaret Birch, et al. each filed substantially similar shareholder derivative actions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and all were assigned to the same judge. The Lipovich and Salsberg actions were consolidated, and defendants moved to dismiss those actions on the ground that plaintiffs’ failure to make a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board was not excused. The hearing on that motion is scheduled for May 2018. Defendants also filed a motion to consolidate, stay, or dismiss the Birch action on the grounds that plaintiffs’ failure to make a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board was not excused, and that the lawsuit is redundant of the Lipovich and Salsberg actions. The hearing on that motion is scheduled for June 2018. Defendants have not yet responded to the Tola, Bicknese, Kellogg, or Lockwood complaints.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements27Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) - RESULTS OF OPERATIONSQ1 2018 was a record first quarter in revenue and exceeded the expectations we set in January 2018. Our transformation to a data-centric company accelerated with the revenue of our data-centric businesses up 25% over the first quarter of last year excluding Intel Security Group (ISecG). Collectively, these businesses now account for 49% of revenue and are on track to cross over 50% of revenue this year — an important milestone for our company. CCG continued to execute well, producing revenue growth within a declining PC market.

After adjusting for the Q1 2017 results of the of Intel Security Group (ISecG), which we divested in Q2 2017, revenue grew 13%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by strong performance across our data-centric businesses, which collectively grew 25% year over year after adjusting for ISecG. Mobileye, which we acquired in Q3 2017, recognized $151 million in revenue, contributing to the growth of our data-centric businesses.

Further, the new Tax Reform provisions related to foreign-derived intangible income favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points, and the provision related to low-taxed intangible income and the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction each unfavorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately one percentage point.

We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. When assessing our sources of liquidity we include investments as shown in the preceding table. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of March 31, 2018, $2.2 billion of commercial paper remained outstanding. We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Results & Analysis35Table of Contents CASH FROM OPERATIONS $B CAPITAL EXPENDITURES $B CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS $B    ■ Dividends         ■ Buybacks  Three Months Ended(In Millions) Mar 31, 2018 Apr 1, 2017Net cash provided by operating activities $6,284 $3,898Net cash used for investing activities (4,791) (2,778)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (1,372) (1,746)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $121 $(626)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.For Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017, the $2.4 billion increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to higher net income and changes in working capital, which benefited from receipts of customer deposits and prepaid supply agreements. These increases were partially offset by adjustments to net income for non-cash items, primarily driven by gains on equity investments.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.Cash used for investing activities was higher for Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017 primarily due to increased net purchases of trading assets and higher capital expenditures.  Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.Cash used for financing activities was lower in Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017 primarily due to the issuance of commercial paper in Q1 2018. This was partially offset by increased repurchases of common stock, repayment of debt, and dividends to stockholders.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. For discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk within MD&A - Results of Operations, in our 2017 Form 10-K.  MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Consolidated Results & Analysis36Table of ContentsOTHER KEY INFORMATIONRISK FACTORSThe risks described in "Risk Factors" within "Other Key Information" in our 2017 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Risk Factors section in our 2017 Form 10-K remains current in all material respects.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe implemented controls relating to adoption of the new revenue recognition and financial instruments accounting standards that were adopted in fiscal year 2018 to ensure that the necessary revenue contracts, equity investments, and related policies and process flows were sufficiently reviewed to identify adoption impacts. There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.OTHER KEY INFORMATION 37Table of ContentsNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. Our non-GAAP operating income and diluted earnings per share reflect adjustments for the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Acquisition-related adjustments: The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company exclude certain expenses related to acquisitions. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. We record charges related to the amortization of these intangibles within both cost of sales and operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.Restructuring and other charges:Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include asset impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with the Intel Security Group divestiture. We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these costs do not reflect our current operating performance. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. Mark to market on marketable equity securities:We exclude gains and losses resulting from mark to market adjustments of our marketable equity securities when calculating certain non-GAAP measures as we do not believe the volatility generally associated with these securities correlates to our core operational performance. Consequently, our non-GAAP earnings per share figures exclude these impacts to facilitate an evaluation of our current performance and comparisons to our past performance.Planned Divestiture of Wind River:We recognized a tax provision adjustment in the first quarter of 2018 due to our planned divestiture of Wind River Systems, Inc. (Wind River). Consequently, our non-GAAP earnings per share figures exclude this impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current performance and comparisons to our past performance.Following are the reconciliations of our most comparable GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:(In Millions) Mar 31, 2018 Apr 1, 2017Operating income $4,470 $3,632Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 325 247Restructuring and other charges — 80Non-GAAP operating income $4,795 $3,959  Mar 31, 2018 Apr 1, 2017Earnings per share - Diluted $0.93 $0.61Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 0.07 0.05Restructuring and other charges — 0.01Mark to market on marketable equity securities  (0.13) —Income tax effect (2018 includes $.01 tax impact from Wind River planned divestiture) — (0.01)Non-GAAP Earnings per share - Diluted $0.87 $0.66OTHER KEY INFORMATION 38Table of ContentsISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESWe have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions.

In our consolidated condensed financial statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan and accordingly are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the preceding table.OTHER KEY INFORMATION 39Table of ContentsEXHIBITS    Incorporated by Reference  ExhibitNumber Exhibit Description Form File Number Exhibit FilingDate Filed orFurnishedHerewith3.1 Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Intel Corporation dated May 17, 2006 8-K 000-06217 3.1 5/22/2006  3.2 Intel Corporation Bylaws, as amended and restated on March 14, 2018 8-K 000-06217 3.2 3/19/2018  12.1 Statement Setting Forth the Computation of Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges         X31.1 Certification of Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)         X31.2 Certification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) of the Exchange Act         X32.1 Certification of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(b) of the Exchange Act and 18 U.S.C.
