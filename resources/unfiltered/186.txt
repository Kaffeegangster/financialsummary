We provide our products and services globally through a direct sales force and an extensive network of channel partners. Management prepared these condensed unaudited interim consolidated financial statements according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial information and notes. As permitted under Article 10 of Regulation S-X and the instructions of Form 10-Q, these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and notes required by United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements, although management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.The Company reclassified $41 million of costs from Accrued liabilities to Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the period ended December 31, 2017 to conform to the current period presentation. A similar reclassification was made to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulting in a change to Accounts payable and Accrued liabilities within Net cash provided by operating activities for the period ended June 30, 2017.In the opinion of the Company, these interim financial statements include all adjustments (of a normal, recurring nature) necessary to present fairly its Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2018, the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the three and six-months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six-months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017. These results, however, are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year ending December 31, 2018. Note 2 Significant Accounting PoliciesRevenue Recognition. Revenue includes sales of hardware, supplies and services (including repair services and product maintenance service contracts, which typically occur over time, and professional services such as installation, integration and provisioning, which typically occur in the early stages of a project).   The average life of repair and maintenance service contracts is approximately three years. The duration of professional service arrangements ranges from a day to several weeks or months.  We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  The Company elects to exclude from the transaction price sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority and collected by the Company from a customer. The Company also considers shipping and handling activities as part of the fulfillment costs, not as a separate performance obligation.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) applying the modified retrospective method to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”). The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or results of operations. The cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated January 1, 2018 balance sheet related to the adoption of ASC 7Table of Contents606 were as follows (in millions): As Reported December 31, 2017 Adjustment As Adjusted January 1, 2018Assets:     Inventories, net (1)$458 $(3) $455Prepaid expenses and other current assets (2)24 7 31Long-term deferred income taxes (3)119 (5) 114Other long-term assets (4)65 12 77      Liabilities:     Deferred revenue (5)186 (2) 184Long-term deferred revenue (6)148 (6) 142      Stockholders’ Equity:     Retained earnings1,248 19 1,267(1)Reflects an adjustment of $(3) million related to changes in revenue recognition patterns.

Had the Company applied the previous revenue recognition guidance, revenue would have been $3 million lower for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and $2 million lower for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018.See Note 3, Revenues for further information.  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted this ASU. ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The new standard requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. It replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. There are two transition methods available under the new standard dependent upon the type of financial instrument, either cumulative effect or prospective. The standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Earlier adoption is permitted only for annual periods after December 15, 2018. Management has assessed the impact of adoption of the new standard and determined there are no material impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures resulting from the adoption of this ASU. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Subtopic 842).” This ASU increases the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and disclosing key quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases were not previously recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The recognition, measurement and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed. This standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees 8Table of Contentsand lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.  While Management is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements, we have identified and collected data on our significant leases, made progress in assessing practical expedients and policy elections we will make upon adoption, as well as, selected an accounting system to support future accounting and disclosure requirements.  At this time, we do not have an estimate of the expected increase in assets and liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet upon adoption of this ASU in the first quarter of 2019.Note 3 Revenues As prescribed in ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.Performance ObligationsWe enter into contract arrangements that may include various combinations of tangible products and services, which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. For these types of contract arrangements, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract has more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate the combined or single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue recorded in the reporting period. We use the accounting guidance on “capable of being distinct” and “distinct within the context of the contract” to help with the aforementioned evaluation. For contract arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices for the products and/or services underlying each performance obligation. When the standalone selling prices are not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling prices primarily based on the expected cost-plus margin approach. For arrangements comprised strictly of the sale of product and performance of maintenance type services where the standalone selling price of the maintenance service is not discernible, we estimate the standalone selling price of the maintenance contract through the use of the residual approach. When the residual approach cannot be applied, regional pricing, marketing strategies and business practices are evaluated and analyzed to derive the estimated standalone selling price through the use of a cost-plus margin methodology.The Company recognizes revenue when transfer of control has occurred for the goods or services sold. Control is deemed to have been transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and has obtained substantially all of the remaining benefits from the goods and services sold. The Company uses judgment in the evaluation of the following criteria: 1) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the transfer of goods or service; 2) the performance creates or enhances an asset that is under control of the customer; 3) the performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the customer and the Company has an enforceable right to payment, in order to determine whether control transfers at a point in time or over time. For each performance obligation satisfied over time, the Company measures its progress toward completion to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Judgment is also used in the evaluation of the following transfer of control criteria: 1) the Company has a present right to payment for the asset; 2) the legal title to the asset has transferred to the customer; 3) the customer has physical possession of the asset; 4) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset; 5) the customer has accepted the asset, in order to determine when revenue should be recognized in a point in time revenue recognition pattern. Assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met, for products and services sold on a standalone basis, revenue is generally recognized upon shipment and by using an output method or time-based method respectively. In cases where a bundle of products and services are delivered to the customer, judgment is required to select the method of progress which best reflects the transfer of control.The Company’s remaining obligations that are greater than one year in duration relate primarily to repair and support services. The aggregated transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations related to these types of service arrangements is $430 million as of June 30, 2018. We expect to recognize these performance obligations over the approximate three-year average contract term. For some of our transactions, products are sold with a right of return, and we may also provide other rebates, price protection, or incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value or the most likely amount method and reduces the revenue by those estimated amounts, only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. These estimates are reviewed and updated, as necessary, at the end of each reporting period.9Table of ContentsRevenue recognized in the reporting period from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was not material for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018.Disaggregation of RevenueThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by product category for each of our segments, Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”), for the three and six-months ended June 30, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 June 30, 2018 Product Category Product CategorySegmentTangible Products Services and Software Total Tangible Products Services and Software TotalAIT$322 $29 $351 $635 $68 $703EVM567 94 661 1,093 193 1,286Total$889 $123 $1,012 $1,728 $261 $1,989In addition, refer to Note 14, Segment Information for Net sales to customers by geographic region.We recognize revenue arising from performance obligations outlined in contracts with our customers that are satisfied at a point in time and over time. Substantially all of our revenue for tangible products is recognized at a point in time, whereby revenue for services and software is predominantly recognized over time.Contract BalancesProgress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accounts receivable, net and Prepaid expenses and other current assets. The opening and closing contract assets balances were $7 million and $5 million, as of January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively, and were recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These contract assets result from timing differences between the billing schedule and the products and services delivery schedules, as well as, the impact from the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations for contracts that include multiple performance obligations. Our policy is to test these contract asset balances for impairment in accordance with ASC 310 Receivables. No impairment losses have been recorded for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018.Deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, consist of payments and billings in advance of our performance. The combined short-term and long-term Deferred revenue balances were $348 million and $334 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. During the three-month and six-month period ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized $55 million and $120 million in revenue respectively, which was previously included in the beginning balance of deferred revenue.  Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component.Costs to obtain a contractOur incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which consist of sales commissions and incremental fringe benefits, are deferred and amortized over the weighted-average contract term, consistent with the guidance in ASC 340 Other Assets and Deferred Costs. The incremental costs to obtain a contract, which were previously expensed as incurred under ASC 605, and the determination of the amortization period are derived at a portfolio level and the amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis. The adoption of ASC 606 required the capitalization of these costs which resulted in an adjustment to increase retained earnings. The Company recorded $12 million to Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2018. The Company recognized amortization expense related to commissions during the three-month and six-month period ended June 30, 2018 of $3 million and $5 million, respectively. The ending balance of the deferred commissions was $12 million as of June 30, 2018. The Company elected a practical expedient permitted by ASC 606, whereby the incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred if the amortization period of the assets would otherwise be one year or less.Note 4 Inventories10Table of ContentsInventories are stated at the lower of a moving-average cost (which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis) and net realizable value. Manufactured inventory cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Purchased inventory cost also includes internal purchasing overhead costs.Provisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Inventory provisions are based on forecasted demand, experience with specific customers, the age and nature of the inventory, and the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or to rework into consumable inventory.The components of Inventories, net are as follows (in millions):  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Raw material$131 $116Work in process2 1Finished goods332 341Total$465 $458Note 5 Costs Associated with Exit and Restructuring ActivitiesIn the first quarter of 2017, the Company’s executive leadership approved an initiative to continue the Company’s efforts to increase operational efficiency (the “Productivity Plan”). The Company expects the Productivity Plan to build upon the exit and restructuring initiatives specific to the acquisition of the Enterprise business (“Enterprise”) from Motorola Solutions, Inc. in October 2014, (the “Acquisition Plan”). The Company completed all initiatives under the Acquisition Plan as of December 31, 2017. Actions under the Productivity Plan include organizational design changes, process improvements and automation. Exit and restructuring costs are not included in the operating results of our segments as they are not deemed to impact the specific segment measures as reviewed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker and therefore are reported as a component of Corporate, eliminations. See Note 14, Segment Information.Total exit and restructuring charges of $17 million life-to-date specific to the Productivity Plan have been recorded through June 30, 2018 and relate to severance and related benefits and other expenses. Exit and restructuring charges of $1 million and $5 million were recorded in the respective three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Total remaining charges associated with this plan are expected to be less than $6 million with activities expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2018.A roll forward of the exit and restructuring accruals is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017 June 30, 2018July 1, 2017Balance at the beginning of the period$7 $11 $8 $10Charged to earnings, net1 1 5 5Cash paid(4) (5) (9) (8)Balance at the end of the period$4 $7 $4 $7The $4 million accrual as of June 30, 2018 is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheet as $3 million within Accrued liabilities and $1 million within Other long-term liabilities. The long-term portion of the accrual relates to non-cancellable lease payments associated with exited facilities whose latest term expires May 2021.Note 6 Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial assets and liabilities are to be measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements.” Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into the following three broad levels:11Table of ContentsLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair                         value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs (e.g. U.S. Treasuries & money market funds).Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. In addition, the Company considers counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value.Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of June 30, 2018, are classified below (in millions): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:       Foreign exchange contracts (1)$1 $16 $— $17Forward interest rate swap contracts (2)— 7 — 7Money market investments related to the deferred compensation plan17 — — 17Total Assets at fair value$18 $23 $— $41Liabilities:       Liabilities related to the deferred compensation plan17 — — 17Total Liabilities at fair value$17 $— $— $17Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of December 31, 2017, are classified below (in millions): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:       Money market investments related to the deferred compensation plan$15 $— $— $15Total Assets at fair value$15 $— $— $15Liabilities:       Forward interest rate swap contracts (2)$— $18 $— $18Foreign exchange contracts (1)2 9 — 11Liabilities related to the deferred compensation plan15 — — 15Total Liabilities at fair value$17 $27 $— $44(1)The fair value of the derivative contracts is calculated as follows:a.Fair value of a put option contract associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using bid and ask rates for similar contracts.b.Fair value of regular forward contracts associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using the period-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward points.c.Fair value of hedges against net assets is calculated at the period-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward points unless the hedge has been traded but not settled at period end (Level 2). If this is the case, the fair value is calculated at the rate at which the hedge is being settled (Level 1). As a result, there were $1 million of transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 as of June 30, 2018 and $2 million as of December 31, 2017.(2)The fair value of forward interest rate swaps is based upon a valuation model that uses relevant observable market inputs at the quoted intervals, such as forward yield curves, and is adjusted for the Company’s credit risk and the interest rate swap terms. See gross balance reporting in Note 7, Derivative Instruments. Note 7 Derivative InstrumentsIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to such risks and may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company 12Table of Contentsformally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.In accordance with ASC 815, the Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures them at fair value. The following table presents the fair value of its derivative instruments (in millions): Asset (Liability) Derivatives   Fair Values as of  Balance Sheet Classification June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Derivative instruments designated as hedges:         Foreign exchange contractsPrepaid expenses and other current assets $16 $—    Foreign exchange contractsAccrued liabilities — (9)    Forward interest rate swapsAccrued liabilities (1) (2)    Forward interest rate swapsOther long-term liabilities (1) (8)Total derivative instruments designated as hedges $14 $(19)      Derivative instruments not designated as hedges:        Foreign exchange contractsPrepaid expenses and other current assets $1 $—    Forward interest rate swapsOther long-term assets 12 —    Foreign exchange contractsAccrued liabilities — (2)    Forward interest rate swapsAccrued liabilities (3) (1)    Forward interest rate swapsOther long-term liabilities — (7)Total derivative instruments not designated as hedges  $10 $(10)Total net derivative asset (liability)  $24 $(29)The following table presents the gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges (in millions): Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Statements of Operations Classification June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017 June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017Derivative instruments not designated as hedges:             Foreign exchange contractsForeign exchange gain (loss) gain $1 $(11) $1 $(16)    Forward interest rate swapsInterest expense, net 5 — 18 1Total gain (loss) recognized in income  $6 $(11) $19 $(15)Credit and Market Risk ManagementFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk of nonperformance and to market risk related to currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk by establishing minimum credit standards, diversifying its counterparties, and monitoring its concentrations of credit. The Company’s credit risk counterparties are commercial banks with expertise in derivative financial instruments. The Company evaluates the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments by considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of the customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company’s credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer.13Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange Risk ManagementThe Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from euro denominated external revenues, cross-border financing activities between subsidiaries, and foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The Company realizes its objective of preserving the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows by initially hedging transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign exchange forward and option contracts.The Company manages the exchange rate risk of anticipated euro denominated sales using put options, forward contracts, and participating forwards, all of which typically mature within twelve months of execution. The Company designates these derivative contracts as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets until the contract is settled and the hedged sale is realized. The realized gain or loss is then recorded as an adjustment to Net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Realized (losses) were $(1) million and $0 million for the quarter ending June 30, 2018, and July 1, 2017, respectively.  For the comparable six-month period ended June 30, 2018, and July 1, 2017, realized (losses) or gains were $(6) million and $1 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the notional amounts of the Company’s foreign exchange cash flow hedges were €402 million and €389 million, respectively. The Company has reviewed cash flow hedges for effectiveness and determined they are highly effective. The Company uses forward contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to manage its exposures related to its Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Czech koruna, Euro, Australian dollar, Swedish krona, Japanese yen, and Singapore dollars, Mexican Peso and Chinese Yuan denominated net assets. These forward contracts typically mature within one-month after execution. Monetary gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in income each quarter and are generally offset by the transaction gains and losses related to their net asset positions. The notional values and the net fair value of these outstanding contracts are as follows (in millions): June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Notional balance of outstanding contracts:   British Pound/U.S. Dollar£16 £13Euro/U.S. Dollar€71 €108British Pound/Euro£5 £5Canadian Dollar/U.S. Dollar$7 $12Czech Koruna/U.S. DollarKč378 Kč361Brazilian Real/U.S. DollarR$31 R$34Australian Dollar/U.S. DollarA$50 A$55Swedish Krona/U.S. Dollarkr14 kr13Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar¥144 ¥151Singapore Dollar/U.S. DollarS$6 S$4Mexican Peso/U.S. DollarMex$127 Mex$Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar¥44 ¥Net fair value of asset (liability) of outstanding contracts$1 $(2)Interest Rate Risk ManagementThe Company’s debt consists of borrowings under two term loans (“Term Loan A” and “Term Loan B”), the Revolving Credit Facility and the receivables financing facility which bear interest at variable rates plus an applicable margin. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risk associated with the variable interest rate payments on both term loans.The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by utilizing interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.14Table of ContentsIn December 2017, the Company entered into an $800 million forward long-term interest rate swap agreement to lock into a fixed LIBOR interest rate base for debt facilities subject to monthly interest payments, including Term Loan A, the Revolving Credit Facility and receivables financing facility. Under the terms of the agreement, $800 million in variable-rate debt will be swapped for a fixed interest rate with net settlement terms due effective in December 2018. The changes in fair value of these swaps are not designated as hedges and are recognized immediately as Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company previously had a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap, which was designated as a cash flow hedge. This swap was terminated and the hedge accounting treatment discontinued in 2014. The terminated swap has approximately $3 million remaining to be amortized through AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassified into net earnings through June 2021. Approximately $2 million is expected to be amortized and expensed in 2018. There was less than $1 million expensed by the Company in the second quarter of 2018 and $1 million expensed for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018.The Company has three interest rate swaps previously entered into for the purpose of converting floating-to-fixed rate debt. The first swap was entered into with a syndicated group of commercial banks for the purpose of moving from floating-to-fixed rate debt. The second swap largely offsets the first swap, moving from fixed-to-floating rate debt. Both of these instruments are not designated as hedges with the changes in fair value recognized in Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The third swap entered into is an interest rate swap converting floating-to-fixed rate debt which was designated as a cash flow hedge and receives hedge accounting treatment. All three swaps have a termination date in June 2021.The changes in fair value of the active swap designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any ineffectiveness immediately recognized in earnings. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps effective in each year of the cash flow hedge relationships does not exceed the principal amount of Term Loan B, which is hedged. The Company has reviewed the interest rate swap hedges for effectiveness and determined they are 100% effective.At June 30, 2018, the Company estimated that approximately $1 million in losses on the forward interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge will be reclassified from AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets into earnings during the next four quarters.The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. The following table presents the (liability) asset gross fair values and related offsetting counterparty fair values as well as the net fair value amounts at June 30, 2018 (in millions): Gross FairValue Offsetting Counterparty Fair Value Net FairValue in theConsolidatedBalanceSheetsCounterparty A$(3) $(1) $(2)Counterparty B(1) — (1)Counterparty C(1) — (1)Counterparty D(2) (1) (1)Counterparty E(1) — (1)Counterparty F15 — 15Counterparty G(2) — (2)Total$5 $(2) $7The interest rate swaps have future maturities consisting of the following notional amounts per year (in millions):15Table of ContentsYear 2018$—Year 20191,344Year 20201,072Year 20211,072Year 2022800Notional balance of outstanding contracts$4,288Note 8 Long-Term DebtThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt (in millions): June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Term Loan B$810 $1,160Term Loan A653 679Revolving Credit Facility433 275Receivables Financing Facility118 135Total debt$2,014 $2,249Less: Debt issuance costs(6) (7)Less: Unamortized discounts(9) (15)Less: Current portion of long-term debt(85) (51)Total long-term debt$1,914 $2,176At June 30, 2018, the future maturities of debt, excluding debt discounts and issuance costs, are as follows (in millions):2018$37201914420205420211,7792022—Thereafter—Total future maturities of long-term debt$2,014The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt approximated $2.0 billion at June 30, 2018 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017. These fair value amounts represent the estimated value at which the Company’s lenders could trade its debt within the financial markets and does not represent the settlement value of these long-term debt liabilities to the Company. The fair value of the long-term debt will continue to vary each period based on fluctuations in market interest rates, as well as changes to the Company’s credit ratings. This methodology resulted in a Level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy.Credit FacilitiesOn May 31, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No.1. to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 1”). Amendment No. 1 replaced the existing Term Loan A with a new Term Loan A (“Amended Term Loan A”) of $670 million and increased the existing revolving credit facility from $500 million to $800 million (“Revolving Credit Facility”).  In addition, as part of the Amendment No. 1, the Company entered into a partial early debt termination of $300 million and repricing of Term Loan B. Amendment No. 1 lowered the index rate spread for LIBOR loans from LIBOR + 200 bp to LIBOR + 175 bp.In accounting for the impact of Amendment No. 1, the Company applied the provisions of ASC Subtopic 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments (“ASC 470-50”), which resulted in the second quarter results including approximately $6 million in non-cash accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and approximately $1 million of one-time pretax charges related to third party fees associated with the amendments, which are reflected as a component of Interest expense,net within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.  16Table of ContentsIn addition, the issuance of Amended Term Loan A and the increase to the revolving credit facility resulted in $2 million of one-time third party fees for arranger, legal, and other services, which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the credit facilities.As of June 30, 2018, the Term Loan A interest rate was 3.84%, and the Term Loan B interest rate was 4.06%. Borrowings under Term Loan A and B bear interest at a variable rate. Term Loan B borrowings are subject to a floor of 2.75%. Interest payments are payable monthly or quarterly on Term Loan A and quarterly on Term Loan B. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on Term Loan B. See Note 7, Derivative Instruments.Amendement No. 1 also requires the Company to prepay certain amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. The Company may make prepayments against the Term Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The borrowings under Amendment No. 1 will mature on July 27, 2021.The Revolving Credit Facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including letters of credit. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had issued letters of credit totaling $5 million, which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to $795 million. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and the related commitments will terminate on July 27, 2021.Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of June 30, 2018, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of 3.91%. Interest payments are payable monthly or quarterly for the Revolving Credit Facility. Receivables Financing Facility On December 1, 2017, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose entity (“SPE”) of the Company entered into the Receivables Purchase Agreement, which provides for a receivables financing facility of up to $180 million. The SPE utilizes the receivables financing facility in the normal course of business as part of its management of cash flows. Under its committed receivables financing facility, a subsidiary of the Company sells its domestically originated accounts receivables at fair value, on a revolving basis, to the SPE which was formed for the sole purpose of buying the receivables. The SPE, in turn, pledges a valid and perfected first-priority security interest in the pool of purchased receivables to a financial institution for borrowing purposes. The subsidiary retains an ownership interest in the pool of receivables that are sold to the SPE and services those receivables. Accordingly, the Company has determined that these transactions do not qualify for sale accounting under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets, and has, therefore, accounted for the transactions as secured borrowings.At June 30, 2018, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $419 million of receivables that were pledged and $118 million of associated liabilities. The receivables financing facility will mature on November 29, 2019.Borrowings under the receivables financing facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of June 30, 2018, the receivables financing facility had an average interest rate of 2.94% and requires monthly interest payments.Both the Revolving Credit Facility and receivables financing facility include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels. Certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”) guarantee the Term Loan A, Term Loan B, and the Revolving Credit Facility on a senior basis. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would have (a) accounted for 47.8% of our total revenue and (b) held 84.0% or $3.6 billion of our total assets and approximately 80.1% or $2.6 billion of our total liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.On June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies WarrantiesIn general, the Company provides warranty coverage of 1 year on mobile computers, printers and batteries. Advanced data capture products are warrantied from 1 to 5 years, depending on the product. Thermal printheads are warrantied for 6 months and battery-based products, such as location tags, are covered by a 90-day warranty. The provision for warranty expense is adjusted quarterly based on historical warranty experience.The following table is a summary of the Company’s accrued warranty obligation (in millions):17Table of Contents  Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017Balance at the beginning of the period$18 $21Warranty expense16 13Warranty payments(16) (15)Balance at the end of the period$18 $19ContingenciesThe Company is subject to a variety of investigations, claims, suits, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to, intellectual property, employment, tort, and breach of contract matters. The Company currently believes that the outcomes of such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its business, cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. Any legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the Company’s view of these matters and its potential effects may change in the future. The Company establishes an accrued liability for loss contingencies related to legal matters when the loss is both probable and estimable. In addition, for some matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of loss is not possible, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. In connection with the acquisition of the Enterprise business from Motorola Solutions, Inc., the Company acquired Symbol Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Motorola Solutions (“Symbol”). A putative federal class action lawsuit, Waring v. Symbol Technologies, Inc., et al., was filed on August 16, 2005 against Symbol Technologies, Inc. and two of its former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by Robert Waring. After the filing of the Waring action, several additional purported class actions were filed against Symbol and the same former officers making substantially similar allegations (collectively, the New Class Actions”). The Waring action and the New Class Actions were consolidated for all purposes and on April 26, 2006, the Court appointed the Iron Workers Local # 580 Pension Fund as lead plaintiff and approved its retention of lead counsel on behalf of the putative class. On August 30, 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (the “Amended Complaint”), and named additional former officers and directors of Symbol as defendants. The lead plaintiff alleges that the defendants misrepresented the effectiveness of Symbol’s internal controls and forecasting processes, and that, as a result, all of the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the individual defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lead plaintiff alleges that it was damaged by the decline in the price of Symbol’s stock following certain purported corrective disclosures and seeks unspecified damages. The court has certified a class of investors that includes those that purchased Symbol common stock between March 12, 2004 and August 1, 2005. The parties completed fact and expert discovery. They also agreed to a schedule for the filing of dispositive motions, which the court so-ordered on February 12, 2018. However, by order entered on April 2, 2018, the court adjourned the deadlines for summary judgment briefing in light of the fact that the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the matter at the mediation held on March 15, 2018. The settlement is subject to approval of the Court pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Zebra has reached agreements with certain of its insurers to fund the settlement. On April 30, 2018, the lead plaintiff commenced the process for obtaining the court’s approval of the settlement by filing a motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement, and on May 22, 2018, the Court entered an order: (1) preliminarily approving the settlement with the hearing for final approval of the settlement terms set for October 30, 2018; (2) approving the notice provisions to be provided to the class; (3) appointing the settlement administrator; and (4) setting forth the procedure and timing by which class members may elect to participate in, opt out of or object to the settlement.  Unclaimed Property Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (“VDA”) and Audits: The Company is currently under audit by several states related to its reporting of unclaimed property liabilities. Additionally, in December 2017, the Company entered into a VDA with the State of Delaware. The Company has engaged an outside consultant to facilitate the assessment of the estimated liability that may result from these activities.  As of June 30, 2018, no significant contingency reserve has been recorded as it has not progressed sufficiently in its assessment to quantify and record a contingency reserve for any unreported unclaimed property liabilities is ongoing.  Note 10 Share-Based CompensationOn May 17, 2018, shareholders approved the Zebra Technologies 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”).  The 2018 Plan superseded and replaced the 2015 Plan on the approval date, except that the 2015 Plan shall remain in effect with respect 18Table of Contentsto outstanding awards under the 2015 Plan until such awards have been exercised, forfeited, canceled, expired or otherwise terminated in accordance with their terms. The 2018 plan provides for incentive compensation to the Company’s non-employee directors, officers and employees. The awards available under the 2018 Plan include Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”), Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”), Performance Share Awards (“PSAs”), Cash-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (“CSRs”), Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”), and Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”). A total of 3,800,000 shares are authorized for delivery under the 2018 Plan. A summary of the equity awards authorized and available for future grants under the 2018 Plan is as follows:Available for future grants at December 31, 2017—Newly authorized shares3,800,000Granted(925)Cancellation and forfeitures—Plan termination—Available for future grants at June 30, 20183,799,075The Zebra Technologies Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2015 Plan”), provided for incentive compensation to the Company’s non-employee directors, officers and employees.

A total of 4 million shares were authorized for delivery under the 2015 Plan. Upon approval of the 2018 plan, there are no shares available for grant under the 2015 plan.A summary of the equity awards authorized and available for future grants under the 2015 Plan is as follows:Available for future grants at December 31, 20171,437,435Newly authorized shares—Granted(360,999)Cancellation and forfeitures—Plan termination(1,076,436)Available for future grants at June 30, 2018—Pre-tax share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was $28 million and $16 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively. Tax related benefits of $5 million were also recognized for the each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, total unearned compensation costs related to the Company’s share-based compensation plans was $75 million, which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining service period of 2.13 years.Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”)A summary of the Company’s SARs outstanding under the 2015 Plan are as follows: Six Months Ended June 30, 2018SARsShares Weighted-AverageExercise PriceOutstanding at beginning of year1,817,991 $65.73Granted87,310 149.57Exercised(384,528) 58.18Forfeited(35,417) 79.69Expired(438) 108.20Outstanding at end of period1,484,918 $72.28Exercisable at end of period797,045 $58.2019Table of ContentsThe fair value of share-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial model. Volatility is based on an average of the implied volatility in the open market and the annualized volatility of the Company’s stock price over its entire stock history. Grants in the table below include SARs that will be settled in the Class A common stock or cash. The following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used for grants of SARs, as well as the fair value of the grants based on those assumptions: June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017Expected dividend yield0% 0%Forfeiture rate8.40% 9.37%Volatility35.93% 35.49%Risk free interest rate2.96% 1.77%Range of interest rates1.68% - 3.00% 0.71% - 2.41%Expected weighted-average life (in years)4.11 4.13Fair value of SARs granted (in millions)$13 $12Weighted-average grant date fair value of SARs granted(per underlying share)$47.59 $29.84The following table summarizes information about SARs outstanding at June 30, 2018: Outstanding Exercisable         Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions)$106 $68Weighted-average remaining contractual term (in years)5.86 5.01The intrinsic value for SARs exercised during the six-months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 was $34 million and $8 million, respectively. The total fair value of SARs vested during the period of June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 was $7 million and $6 million, respectively.The Company’s SARs are expensed straight-line over the vesting period of the related award, which is typically 4 years. Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”) and Performance Share Awards (“PSAs”)The Company’s restricted stock grants consist of time-vested restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) and performance vested restricted stock awards (“PSAs”). The RSAs and PSAs hold voting rights and therefore are considered participating securities. The outstanding RSAs and PSAs are included as part of the Company’s Class A Common Stock outstanding. The RSAs and PSAs vest at each vesting date subject to restrictions such as continuous employment except in certain cases as set forth in each stock agreement. The Company’s restricted stock awards are expensed straight-line over the vesting period of the related award, which is typically 3 years. The RSAs granted beginning in 2018 will grade vest over the 3-year vesting period. Some awards, including those granted annually to non-employee directors as an equity retainer fee, were vested upon grant. PSAs targets are set based on certain Company-wide financial metrics. Compensation cost is calculated as the market date fair value on grant date multiplied by the number of shares granted.The Company also issues stock awards to non-employee directors. Each director receives an equity grant of shares every year during the month of May. The number of shares granted to each director is determined by dividing the value of the annual grant by the price of a share of common stock. During the first six months of 2018, there were 7,980 shares granted to non-employee directors compared to 12,488 shares in the first six months of prior year. The shares vest immediately upon the grant date.A summary of information relative to the Company’s restricted stock awards is as follows:20Table of Contents  Six Months Ended  June 30, 2018Restricted Stock Awards Shares Weighted-AverageGrant Date Fair ValueOutstanding at beginning of year 628,642 $77.70Granted 199,025 149.41Released (144,957) 109.21Forfeited (16,494) 83.89Outstanding at end of period 666,216 $92.26The fair value of each performance award granted includes assumptions around the Company’s performance goals.

The RSUs granted beginning in 2018 will grade vest over the 3-year vesting period. Compensation cost is calculated as the market date fair value on grant date multiplied by the number of share-equivalents granted. The fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period. Cash settlement payments for these awards of $2.0 million and $1.0 million were made during the six-months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively. Share-equivalents issued under these programs totaled 17,253 and 45,781 during the six-months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively.Non-qualified Stock OptionsA summary of the Company’s options outstanding under the 2006 Plan is as follows:  Six Months Ended  June 30, 2018Non-qualified Options Shares Weighted-AverageExercise PriceOutstanding at beginning of year 15,705 $26.34Exercised (9,083) 31.26Expired — —Outstanding at end of period 6,622 $19.59Exercisable at end of period 6,622 $19.59The following table summarizes information about non-qualified stock options outstanding at June 30, 2018:21Table of Contents Outstanding              Exercisable         Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions)$1 $1Weighted-average remaining contractual term (in years)0.42 0.42The intrinsic value for non-qualified options exercised during the six-months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 was $1 million and $5 million, respectively. Cash received from the exercise of non-qualified options during the six-months ended June 30, 2018 was less than $1 million compared to $3 million in the prior year period. The related tax benefit realized was $1 million during both the six-months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017. Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Zebra Technologies Corporation 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2011 Plan”), which became effective in fiscal 2011, permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at 95% of the fair market value at the date of purchase. Employees may make purchases by cash or payroll deductions up to certain limits. The aggregate number of shares that may be purchased under this plan is 1,500,000 shares. At June 30, 2018, 869,514 shares were available for future purchase.Note 11 Income Taxes The Company’s effective tax rates for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 were 30.0% and 23.2%, respectively. The variance from the 2018 federal statutory rate of 21% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 was attributable to increases related to foreign earnings subject to U.S. taxation, the U.S. impact of the Enterprise acquisition, partially offset by lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and the generation of tax credits in the current year. The Company’s effective tax rate was further increased by additional uncertain tax positions, adjustments to provisional items related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (“U.S. Tax Reform” or “the Act”), and partially decreased by share-based compensation benefits. The increase in uncertain tax positions is related to interpretive guidance issued during the second quarter of 2018 that impacted management’s judgment with respect to prior year tax positions.In the prior year, the effective tax rates for the three-month and six-month periods ended July 1, 2017 were 10.5% and (47.1)%, respectively. The variance from the 2017 federal statutory rate of 35% for the three months and six months ended July 1, 2017 was attributable to lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the generation of tax credits and benefits for share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the U.S. impact of the Enterprise acquisition and state deferred tax expense due to changes in our business operations. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended July 1, 2017 was further reduced by benefits associated with an intercompany sale of intellectual property and a rate decrease in Singapore.Pre-tax earnings outside the United States are primarily generated in the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Luxembourg, with statutory rates of 19%, 17%, and 27%, respectively. During 2017, the Company received approval from the Singapore Economic Development Board for a tax rate of 10% with the Company’s commitment to make increased investments in Singapore. The Singapore incentivized rate expires on December 31, 2018.Quarterly, Management evaluates all jurisdictions based on historical pre-tax earnings and taxable income to determine the need for valuation allowances. Based on this analysis, a valuation allowance has been recorded for any jurisdictions where, in the Company’s judgment, tax benefits will not be realized.Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is currently undergoing U.S. Federal income tax audits for the years 2013 through 2015, as well as UK income tax years 2012 and 2014. The tax years 2004 through 2016 remain open to examination by multiple foreign and U.S. state taxing jurisdictions. The Company continues to believe its positions are supportable, however, the Company anticipates that $22 million of uncertain tax benefits may be disallowed within the next twelve months and has reflected this liability as current within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $13 million charge related to increases in income tax uncertainties for prior year tax positions. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit or litigation outcome, the Company’s estimates of the ultimate settlement of uncertain tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.Impact of U.S. Tax Reform    Enacted on December 22, 2017, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. Based on current operations, we estimate that the Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income and the Deduction for 22Table of ContentsForeign-Derived Intangible Income provisions of the Act. We estimate that the new limitations which defer U.S. interest deductions in excess of 30% of Adjusted Taxable Income are not applicable. Additionally, the Company is no longer able to deduct performance-based compensation for its covered employees which exceeds the limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). These impacts are included in the calculation of our annual estimated effective tax rate.Provisional amountsAt June 30, 2018, we continue to analyze the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act. The Company remeasured U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the remeasurement of deferred taxes requires further analysis regarding the state tax impacts of the remeasurement, the impact of the Act on the taxation of executive compensation arrangements, changes to tax capitalization provisions and other aspects of the Act that may impact our tax balances.The Company recorded a provisional amount of $36 million in the December 31, 2017 financial statements for the one-time transition tax. The Internal Revenue Service issued Notice 2018-26 on April 2, 2018, which required an additional $8 million of tax expense to be recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2018, increasing the total provisional amount to $44 million. The Company utilized $10 million of deferred tax assets for income tax credits available to offset the one-time transition tax, and estimates its cash tax liability to be $34 million, that will be remitted over the next eight years in annual amounts ranging from $3 to $8 million.We continue to evaluate the transition charge based on guidance issued. The transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This calculation may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 foreign earnings and profit previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.  The Company earns a significant amount of its operating income outside of the U.S. The Company’s policy considers its U.S. investment in directly-owned foreign affiliates to be indefinitely reinvested. Under the Act, future unremitted foreign earnings will no longer be subject to tax when repatriated to its U.S. parent, but may be subject to withholding taxes of the payor affiliate country. Additionally, gains and losses on taxable dispositions of U.S.-owned foreign affiliates continue to be subject to U.S. tax.Note 12 Earnings per ShareBasic net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares assuming dilution. Dilutive common shares outstanding is computed using the Treasury Stock method and in periods of income, reflects the additional shares that would be outstanding if dilutive stock options were exercised for common shares during the period.

Outstanding options to purchase common shares were anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculations of 87,310 and 701,272 for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively. Anti-dilutive securities consist primarily of stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) with an exercise price greater than the average market closing price of the Class A common stock.Note 13 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Stockholders’ equity includes certain items classified as Accumulated other comprehensive loss, including:•Unrealized (loss) gain on anticipated sales hedging transactions relates to derivative instruments used to hedge the exposure related to currency exchange rates for forecasted Euro sales. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and the Company defers income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transaction occurs. See Note 7, Derivative Instruments for more details.•Unrealized (loss) gain on forward interest rate swaps hedging transactions refers to the hedging of the interest rate risk exposure associated with the variable rate commitment entered into for the Enterprise Acquisition. See Note 7, Derivative Instruments for more details.•Foreign currency translation adjustments relate to the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates. This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCI”) for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 are as follows (in millions):  Unrealized (loss) gain on sales hedging Unrealized (loss)/ gain on forward interest rate swaps Currency translation adjustments TotalBalance at December 31, 2016 $6 $(15) $(36) $(45)Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications (16) 1 — (15)Amounts reclassified from AOCI(1) (1) 1 — —Tax benefit 3 — — 3Other comprehensive (loss) income  (14) 2 — (12)Balance at July 1, 2017 $(8) $(13) $(36) $(57)         Balance at December 31, 2017 $(9) $(9) $(34) $(52)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 21 7 (7) 21Amounts reclassified from AOCI(1) 6 2 — 8Tax (expense) (5) (2) — (7)Other comprehensive income (loss) 22 7 (7) 22Balance at June 30, 2018 $13 $(2) $(41) $(30)(1) See Note 7, Derivative Instruments regarding timing of reclassifications on forward interest rate swaps. Note 14 Segment InformationThe Company’s operations consist of two reportable segments: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”). The reportable segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker or “CODM”) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Company’s segments. The CODM reviews adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. Adjusted operating income excludes purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and 24Table of Contentsintegration costs, and exit and restructuring costs. Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company’s CODM and therefore are not disclosed below.Financial information by segment is presented as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017 June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017Net sales:       AIT$351 $313 $703 $635EVM661 584 1,286 1,128Total segment net sales1,012 897 1,989 1,763Corporate, eliminations (1)— (1) — (2)Total net sales$1,012 $896 $1,989 $1,761Operating income:       AIT(3)$77 $61 $169 $135EVM(3)73 70 153 118Total segment operating income150 131 322 253Corporate, eliminations (2)(25) (73) (53) (155)Total operating income$125 $58 $269 $98(1)Amounts included in Corporate, eliminations consist of purchase accounting adjustments related to the Enterprise Acquisition.(2)Amounts included in Corporate, eliminations consist of purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, and exit and restructuring costs.(3)Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its methodology for allocating certain operating expenses across its two reportable segments to more accurately reflect where these operating costs are being incurred. The reallocations relate primarily to information technology, marketing and human resources expenses. Prior year segment operating results have been recast for comparability with the current year presentation. For the quarter ended July 1, 2017, $2 million of operating expenses were reclassified from EVM to AIT. For the six-month period ended July 1, 2017, $5 million of operating expenses were reclassified from AIT to EVM. For the full year ended December 31, 2017, $14 million of operating expenses were reclassified from AIT to EVM. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of these reclassifications.Information regarding the Company’s operations by geographic area is contained in the following table. These amounts are reported in the geographic area of the destination of the final sale. Net sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017 June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017Europe, Middle East and Africa$337 $279 $686 $566Latin America57 57 113 110Asia-Pacific134 123 249 231North America484 437 941 854Total Net sales$1,012 $896 $1,989 $1,761Note 15 Subsequent EventsDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company began settlement discussions associated with a pending commercial lawsuit.  On July 27, 2018, the Company and plaintiff executed an agreement resolving the lawsuit in its entirety. As a result, the Company recorded a $13 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2018, which is reflected as a component of General and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  25Table of ContentsOn July 5, 2018, Zebra entered into a definitive agreement under which Zebra will acquire all outstanding common stock of Xplore Technologies Corporation for $6.00 per share in cash. Under the terms of the agreement, Zebra plans to effect the acquisition via a tender offer. The aggregate consideration of the transaction, including assumed indebtedness, is expected to be less than or equal to $90 million. Zebra expects to fund the transaction with a combination of cash on hand along with fully committed financing available under its Revolving Credit Facility. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.  The tender offer was filed on July 17, 2018. The acquired business will become part of the EVM segment.Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsZebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Zebra” or “Company”) is a global leader respected for innovative Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) solutions in the automatic identification and data capture industry.

AcquisitionOn July 5, 2018, Zebra entered into a definitive agreement under which Zebra will acquire all outstanding common stock of Xplore Technologies Corporation for $6.00 per share in cash. Under the terms of the agreement, Zebra plans to effect the acquisition via a tender offer.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018. The tender offer was filed on July 17, 2018. The acquired business will become part of our EVM segment.Legal SettlementDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company began settlement discussions associated with a pending commercial lawsuit. On July 27, 2018, the Company and plaintiff executed an agreement resolving the lawsuit in its entirety. As a result, the 26Table of ContentsCompany recorded a $13 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2018, which is reflected as a component of General and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is currently undergoing U.S. Federal income tax audits for the years 2013 through 2015, as well as UK income tax years 2012 and 2014. The tax years 2004 through 2016 remain open to examination by multiple foreign and U.S. state taxing jurisdictions. The Company continues to believe its positions are supportable, however, the Company anticipates that $22 million of uncertain tax benefits may be disallowed within the next twelve months and has reflected this liability as current within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $13 million charge related to income tax uncertainties for prior year tax positions. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit or litigation outcome, the Company’s estimates of the ultimate settlement of uncertain tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.Impact of U.S. Tax ReformEnacted on December 22, 2017, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. Based on current operations, we estimate that the Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income and the Deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income provisions of the Act. We estimate that the new limitations which defer U.S. interest deductions in excess of 30% of Adjusted Taxable Income are not applicable. Additionally, the Company is no longer able to deduct performance-based compensation for its covered employees which exceeds the limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). These impacts are included in the calculation of our annual estimated effective tax rate.Provisional amountsAt June 30, 2018, we continue to analyze the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act.

However, the remeasurement of deferred taxes requires further analysis regarding the state tax impacts of the remeasurement, the impact of the Act on the taxation of executive compensation arrangements, changes to tax capitalization provisions and other aspects of the Act that may impact our tax balances.  The Company recorded a provisional amount of $36 million in the December 31, 2017 financial statements for the one-time transition tax. The Internal Revenue Service issued Notice 2018-26 on April 2, 2018, which required an additional $8 million of tax expense to be recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2018, increasing the total provisional amount to $44 million. The Company utilized $10 million of deferred tax assets for income tax credits available to offset the one-time transition tax, and estimates its cash tax liability to be $34 million, that will be remitted over the next eight years in annual amounts ranging from $3 to $8 million.See Note 11, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations The following tables present key statistics for the Company’s operations for the three and six-months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively (in millions, except percentages):   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017 $ Change % Change June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017 $ Change % ChangeNet sales$1,012 $896 $116 12.9 % $1,989 $1,761 $228 12.9 %Gross profit472 411 61 14.8 % 937 812 125 15.4 %Operating expenses347 353 (6) (1.7)% 668 714 (46) (6.4)%Operating income$125 $58 $67 115.5 % $269 $98 $171 174.5 %Gross margin46.6% 45.9%     47.1% 46.1%    Net sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (in millions, except percentages):27Table of Contents Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017 $ Change % Change June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017 $ Change % ChangeEMEA$337 $279 $58 20.8% $686 $566 $120 21.2%Latin America57 57 — —% 113 110 3 2.7%Asia-Pacific134 123 11 8.9% 249 231 18 7.8% Total International528 459 69 15.0% 1,048 907 141 15.5%North America484 437 47 10.8% 941 854 87 10.2%Total net sales$1,012 $896 $116 12.9% $1,989 $1,761 $228 12.9%Operating expenses are summarized below (in millions, except percentages): Three Months EndedSix Months Ended June 30, 2018July 1, 2017$ Change% ChangeJune 30, 2018July 1, 2017$ Change% ChangeSelling and marketing$121 $114 $7 6.1 % $241 $223 $18 8.1 %Research and development109 99 10 10.1 % 210 195 15 7.7 %General and administrative93 68 25 36.8 % 164 143 21 14.7 %Amortization of intangible assets23 52 (29) (55.8)% 46 102 (56) (54.9)%Acquisition and integration costs— 19 (19) (100.0)% 2 46 (44) (95.7)%Exit and restructuring costs1 1 — — % 5 5 — — %Total operating expenses$347 $353 $(6) (1.7)% $668 $714 $(46) (6.4)%Consolidated Organic Net sales growth: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 June 30, 2018Reported GAAP Consolidated Net sales growth12.9 % 12.9 %Adjustments:   Impact of foreign currency translation (1)(2.3)% (2.7)%Consolidated Organic Net sales growth10.6 % 10.2 %(1)Operating results reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This impact is calculated by translating, for certain currencies, the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, rather than the exchange rates in effect during the current period. In addition, we exclude the impact of the company’s foreign currency hedging program in both the current and prior year periods.Second quarter 2018 compared to second quarter 2017 Net sales increased by $116 million or 12.9% compared with the prior year period, reflecting growth in EMEA, North America, and Asia-Pacific. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales of data capture, barcode printing, and mobile computing products. Net sales growth was also positively impacted by currency changes, primarily in the EMEA region. Consolidated Organic Net Sales growth was 10.6%.28Table of ContentsGross margin increased to 46.6% in the current period compared to 45.9% in the prior year period. Gross margin improvement included favorable foreign currency changes and was driven by higher margins in EVM, partially offset by a slight decline in AIT margins.Operating expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, were $347 million and $353 million, or 34.3% and 39.4% of net sales, respectively. The reduction in operating expenses was primarily due to lower amortization expense and acquisition and integration charges being partially offset by higher compensation costs, including the impact of higher incentive-based compensation associated with financial performance as well as a $13 million pretax charge related to a legal settlement included within general and administrative expense in the current year. The lower amortization expense results from certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Additionally, the Company had no acquisition and integration charges in the current period as a result of completing the integration activities associated with the October 2014 acquisition of the Enterprise business (the “Acquisition”) during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating income increased 115.5% to $125 million for the current period compared to $58 million for the prior year period. The increase was due to higher sales and gross profit and lower operating expenses.Total Other expenses, net was $25 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $39 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease versus the prior year quarter was primarily driven by a $17 million decrease in interest expense due to a $5 million gain from interest rate swaps, lower outstanding debt and interest rates, being partially offset by $7 million of accelerated debit issuance cost amortization and third-party fees related to debt restructuring activities in the current period.In the quarter ending June 30, 2018, the Company recognized tax expense of $30 million compared to an expense of $2 million for the prior year quarter. The Company’s effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 were 30.0% and 10.5%, respectively. The increase in the effective rate in 2018 versus the prior year is primarily due to discrete tax items offset by the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform.Year to date 2018 compared to year to date 2017Net sales increased by $228 million or 12.9% compared with the prior year period, reflecting growth across all regions, most notably EMEA, North America, and Asia-Pacific. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales of mobile computing, barcode printing and data capture products. Net sales growth was also positively impacted by currency changes, primarily in the EMEA region. Consolidated Organic Net Sales growth was 10.2%.Gross margin increased to 47.1% in the current period compared to 46.1% in the prior year period. Gross margin improvement included favorable foreign currency changes and was driven by higher margins in both the EVM and AIT segments primarily due to favorable business mix and improved business costs.Operating expenses for the period ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, were $668 million and $714 million, or 33.6% and 40.5% of net sales, respectively. The reduction in operating expenses was primarily due to lower amortization expense and acquisition and integration charges being partially offset by higher compensation costs, including the impact of higher incentive-based compensation associated with financial performance as well as a $13 million pretax charge related to a legal settlement included within general and administrative expense in the current year. The lower amortization expense results from certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  Additionally, the Company had lower acquisition and integration charges in the current period as compared to the prior year period as a result of completing of the integration activities associated with the October 2014 acquisition of the Enterprise business (the “Acquisition”) during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating income increased 174.5% to $269 million for the current period compared to $98 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales and gross profit and lower operating expenses.Total Other expenses, net was $36 million for the period ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $81 million in the prior year period. The decrease versus the prior year period was primarily driven by a decrease in Interest expense, net of $47 million resulting from an $18 million gain from interest rate swaps, lower outstanding debt and interest rates, being partially offset by $7 million of accelerated debit issuance cost amortization and third party fees related to debt restructuring activities in the current period.For the six-months ending June 30, 2018, the Company recognized a tax expense of $54 million compared to a tax benefit of $8 million for the prior year period. The Company’s effective tax rates for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 29Table of ContentsJuly 1, 2017 were 23.2% and (47.1)%. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2018 versus the prior year is primarily due to discrete tax items offset by the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform.

The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales of barcode printing products and supplies. Barcode printer growth was broad based across all major product lines and primarily within North America and EMEA regions. Net sales growth was also positively impacted by currency changes, primarily in the EMEA region. AIT Organic Net Sales growth was 9.9%.Gross margin decreased to 49.3% in the current period compared to 49.5% in the prior year period. The decrease primarily related to higher transitional costs incurred to insource our North America support services as well as a reduction of reserves in the prior year related to price concessions on certain product sales in China. These factors more than offset favorable product mix and the positive impact of currency changes.Operating income for the period increased 26.2% primarily due to higher sales and gross profit.Year to date 2018 compared to year to date 201730Table of ContentsNet sales for AIT increased $68 million or 10.7% compared to the prior year period.

Management believes that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):  Six Months EndedCash flows provided by (used in) from:June 30, 2018 July 1, 2017 $ Change % ChangeOperating activities$266 $203 $63 31.0 %Investing activities(33) (22) (11) 50.0 %Financing activities(242) (238) (4) 1.7 %Effect of exchange rates on cash(7) (4) (3) 75.0 %Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents$(16) $(61) $45 (73.8)%The change in the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance as of June 30, 2018 is reflective of the following:•Cash flow provided by operating activities increased by $63 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher net income, lower cash payments for income taxes and interest as well as improved inventory management that was partially offset by timing of accounts receivable collections as well as unfavorable changes in accrued liabilities resulting from higher incentive compensation payments as compared to the prior year period.•The increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by higher capital expenditures. •Net cash used in financing activities during the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 consisted primarily of net debt repayments of $235 million compared to $240 million in the six-month period ended July 1, 2017. The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt (in millions): June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Term Loan B$810 $1,160Term Loan A653 679Revolving Credit Facility433 275Receivables Financing Facility118 135Total debt$2,014 $2,249Less: Debt issuance costs(6) (7)Less: Unamortized discounts(9) (15)Less: Current portion of long-term debt(85) (51)Total long-term debt$1,914 $2,17632Table of ContentsAt June 30, 2018, the future maturities of debt, excluding debt discounts and issuance costs, are as follows (in millions):2018$37201914420205420211,7792022—Thereafter—Total future maturities of long-term debt$2,014The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt approximated $2.0 billion at June 30, 2018 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017. These fair value amounts represent the estimated value at which the Company’s lenders could trade its debt within the financial markets and does not represent the settlement value of these long-term debt liabilities to the Company. The fair value of the long-term debt will continue to vary each period based on fluctuations in market interest rates, as well as changes to the Company’s credit ratings. This methodology resulted in a Level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy.Credit FacilitiesOn May 31, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No.1 to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 1”). Amendment No. 1 replaced the existing Term Loan A with a new Term Loan A (“Amended Term Loan A”) of $670 million and increased the existing revolving credit facility from $500 million to $800 million (“Revolving Credit Facility”).  In addition, as part of the Amendment No. 1, the Company entered into a partial early debt termination of $300 million and repricing of Term Loan B. Amendment No. 1 lowered the index rate spread for LIBOR loans from LIBOR + 200 bp to LIBOR + 175 bp.In accounting for the impact of Amendment No. 1, the Company applied the provisions of ASC Subtopic 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments (“ASC 470-50”), which resulted in the second quarter results including approximately $6 million in non-cash accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and approximately $1 million of one-time pretax charges related to third party fees associated with the amendments, which are reflected as a component of Interest expense,net within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.  In addition, the issuance of Amended Term Loan A and the increase to the revolving credit facility resulted in $2 million of one-time third party fees for arranger, legal, and other services, which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the credit facilities.As of June 30, 2018, the Term Loan A interest rate was 3.84%, and the Term Loan B interest rate was 4.06%. Borrowings under Term Loan A and B bear interest at a variable rate. Term Loan B borrowings are subject to a floor of 2.75%. Interest payments are payable monthly or quarterly on Term Loan A and quarterly on Term Loan B. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on Term Loan B. See Note 7, Derivative Instruments.Amendement No. 1 also requires the Company to prepay certain amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. The Company may make prepayments against the Term Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The borrowings under Amendment No. 1 will mature on July 27, 2021.The Revolving Credit Facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including letters of credit. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had issued letters of credit totaling $5 million, which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to $795 million. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and the related commitments will terminate on July 27, 2021.Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of June 30, 2018, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of 3.91%. Interest payments are payable monthly or quarterly for the Revolving Credit Facility. Receivables Financing Facility On December 1, 2017, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose entity (“SPE”) of the Company entered into the Receivables Purchase Agreement, which provides for a receivables financing facility of up to $180 million. The SPE utilizes the receivables financing facility in the normal course of business as part of its management of cash flows. Under its committed 33Table of Contentsreceivables financing facility, a subsidiary of the Company sells its domestically originated accounts receivables at fair value, on a revolving basis, to the SPE which was formed for the sole purpose of buying the receivables. The SPE, in turn, pledges a valid and perfected first-priority security interest in the pool of purchased receivables to a financial institution for borrowing purposes. The subsidiary retains an ownership interest in the pool of receivables that are sold to the SPE and services those receivables. Accordingly, the Company has determined that these transactions do not qualify for sale accounting under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets, and has, therefore, accounted for the transactions as secured borrowings.At June 30, 2018, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $419 million of receivables that were pledged and $118 million of associated liabilities. The receivables financing facility will mature on November 29, 2019.Borrowings under the receivables financing facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of June 30, 2018, the receivables financing facility had an average interest rate of 2.94% and requires monthly interest payments.Both the Revolving Credit Facility and receivables financing facility include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels. Certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”) guarantee the Term Loan A, Term Loan B, and the Revolving Credit Facility on a senior basis. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would have (a) accounted for 47.8% of our total revenue and (b) held 84.0% or $3.6 billion of our total assets and approximately 80.1% or $2.6 billion of our total liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.On June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.As of June 30, 2018, the Company’s cash position of $46 million included foreign cash and investments of $44 million.Management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements. Significant CustomersThe net sales to significant customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows: Six Months EndedJune 30, 2018 July 1, 2017AIT EVM Total AIT EVM TotalCustomer A6.5% 14.5% 21.0% 6.9% 14.3% 21.2%Customer B5.5% 10.2% 15.7% 4.6% 8.5% 13.1%Customer C6.4% 7.6% 14.0% 6.4% 6.6% 13.0%At June 30, 2018, the Company has three customers that each accounted for more than 10% of outstanding accounts receivable. The largest customers accounted for 34.1%, 22.1%, and 19.7% of outstanding accounts receivable. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total net sales during these periods. The customers disclosed above are distributors (i.e. not end users) of the Company’s products.

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented.Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere were no material changes in the Company’s market risk during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. For additional information on market risk, refer to the “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.In the normal course of business, portions of the Company’s operations are subject to fluctuations in currency values. The Company manages these risks using derivative financial instruments. See Note 7, Derivative Instruments to the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further discussion of derivative instruments.Item 4.Controls and ProceduresManagement’s Report on Disclosure ControlsOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the 35Table of ContentsSEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our management assessed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls as of June 30, 2018. Based on this assessment and those criteria, our management believes that, as of June 30, 2018, our disclosure controls are effective.Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting During the second quarter ended June 30, 2018, there have been no changes in our internal controls that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls The Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.36Table of ContentsPART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.Legal ProceedingsSee Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.Item 1A.Risk FactorsIn addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the factors identified under “Safe Harbor” at the end of Item 2 of Part I of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The risks described in the Annual Report are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial also may materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and/or operating results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2017, other than as described below.The impact of changes in customs duties and trade policies in the United States and corresponding actions by other countries in which the Company does business could adversely affect our financial performance. The U.S. government has imposed customs duties on various imports from China that are intended to address trade imbalances and encourage increased production in the United States.  These actions will result in increased customs duties and will likely result in the renegotiation of some U.S. trade agreements. In response to such actions, China has instituted customs duties on certain U.S. goods.  Other governments could also institute customs duties on U.S. goods similar to China’s actions in response to the U.S. government’s customs duties.  The Company imports a significant percentage of our products into the United States and China, and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the Company’s financial performance. Such customs duties also may cause the U.S.’ trading partners, other than China, to take actions with respect to U.S. imports or U.S. investment activities in their respective countries. Any potential changes in trade policies in the United States and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the Company does business could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance. Given the level of uncertainty over which provisions will be enacted, the Company cannot predict with certainty the impact of the proposals.Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of ProceedsTreasury SharesWe did not purchase shares of Zebra Class A common stock during the period ending June 30, 2018 as part of the purchase plan program.In November 2011, our Board authorized the purchase of up to an additional 3,000,000 shares under the purchase plan program and the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is 665,475.
