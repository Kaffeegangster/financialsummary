The words “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “will”, “should” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management’s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations and are subject to a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. Such factors include but are not limited to: our ability to address our business challenges in order to reverse revenue declines, reduce costs and increase productivity so that we can invest in and grow our business; changes in economic and political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements and tax laws in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and to protect our intellectual property rights; the risk that multi-year contracts with governmental entities could be terminated prior to the end of the contract term and that civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could be imposed on us if we fail to comply with the terms of such contracts and applicable law; the risk that partners, subcontractors and software vendors will not perform in a timely, quality manner; actions of competitors and our ability to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations; our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to maintain and improve cost efficiency of operations, including savings from restructuring actions; the risk that individually identifiable information of customers, clients and employees could be inadvertently disclosed or disclosed as a result of a breach of our security systems; reliance on third parties, including subcontractors, for manufacturing of products and provision of services; our ability to manage changes in the printing environment and expand equipment placements; interest rates, cost of borrowing and access to credit markets; funding requirements associated with our employee pension and retiree health benefit plans; the risk that our operations and products may not comply with applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, particularly environmental regulations and directives and anti-corruption laws; the outcome of litigation and regulatory proceedings to which we may be a party; the outcome of our process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including terminating or restructuring Xerox's relationship with FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation ("Fujifilm"); international trade policies and their impact on the cost of and demand for our products and our competitive position, including the imposition of new tariffs or changes in existing tariff rates; and other factors that are set forth in the “Risk Factors” section, the “Legal Proceedings” section, the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 and our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Xerox assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as required by law.Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. (“Fuji Xerox”) is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm in which Xerox holds a noncontrolling 25% equity interest and Fujifilm holds the remaining equity interest. Given our status as a minority investor, we have limited contractual and other rights to information with respect to Fuji Xerox matters. In April 2017, Fujifilm formed an independent investigation committee (the “IIC”) to primarily conduct a review of the appropriateness of the accounting practices at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand subsidiary and at other subsidiaries. The IIC completed its review during the second quarter 2017 and identified aggregate adjustments to Fuji Xerox’s financial statements of approximately JPY 40 billion (approximately $360 million) primarily related to misstatements at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand and Australian subsidiaries. We determined that our share of the total adjustments identified as part of the investigation was approximately $90 million and impacted our fiscal years 2009 through 2017. We revised our previously issued annual and interim consolidated financial statements for 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox continue to review Fujifilm’s oversight and governance of Fuji Xerox as well as Fuji Xerox’s oversight and governance over its businesses in light of the findings of the IIC.  In 2018, in connection with the completion of audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified. These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 previously revised for the items identified by the IIC noted above. At this time, we can provide no assurances relative to the outcome of any potential governmental investigations or any consequences thereof that may happen as a result of this matter.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q1Table of Contents                                  XEROX CORPORATIONFORM 10-QSeptember 30, 2018 TABLE OF CONTENTS  PagePart I — Financial Information Item 1.Financial Statements (Unaudited)3 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income3 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income4 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets5 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows6 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements7Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations39 Capital Resources and Liquidity53 Financial Risk Management55 Non-GAAP Financial Measures56Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk59Item 4.Controls and Procedures59Part II — Other Information Item 1.Legal Proceedings60Item 1A.Risk Factors60Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds60Item 3.Defaults Upon Senior Securities61Item 4.Mine Safety Disclosures61Item 5.Other Information61Item 6.Exhibits62Signatures63Exhibit Index64For additional information about Xerox Corporation and access to our Annual Reports to Shareholders and SEC filings, free of charge, please visit our website at www.xerox.com/investor.

Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. You should read these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2017 Annual Report.In our opinion, all adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of financial position, operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented, have been made. These adjustments consist of normal recurring items. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of the full year.For convenience and ease of reference, we refer to the financial statement caption “Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income” as “pre-tax income.” In third quarter 2018, we determined that the Pension Benefit Obligation (PBO) for our UK funded pension plan at December 31, 2017 was overstated by approximately GBP 40 million (approximately USD $53 or $43 after-tax). The error was the result of the plan administrator under reporting benefit payments. The correction of the PBO was recorded as an out-of-period adjustment in the third quarter 2018 with the offset to the balance sheet recorded as a credit to Changes in defined benefit plans, net in Other comprehensive income for the period. We assessed the impact of this error and concluded that it was not material to the financial statements previously issued for any interim or annual period and the correction of the error in the third quarter 2018 is not expected to be material to the annual financial statements for 2018.Note 2 – Adoption of New Revenue Recognition StandardAdoption Summary:On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASC Topic 606 defines a five-step process to recognize revenue and requires more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process than required under previous U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. We adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Under ASC Topic 606, based on the nature of our contracts and consistent with prior practice, we recognize revenue upon invoicing the customer for the large majority of our revenue. Additionally, the unit of accounting, that is, the identification of performance obligations, is consistent with prior revenue recognition practice. Accordingly, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact for the large majority of our revenues. Lastly, a significant portion of our Equipment sales are either recorded as sales-type leases or through direct sales to distributors and resellers and these revenue streams are not impacted by the adoption of ASC Topic 606. The only change of significance identified in our adoption involves a change in the classification of certain revenues that were previously reported in Services revenues. These revenues relate to certain analyst services performed in connection with the installation of equipment that are being considered part of the equipment sale performance obligation in 2018. Accordingly, in 2018 these revenues are now reported as part of Sales. As a result of this change, $8 and $25 of revenue was recorded, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as Sales, which would have been previously recorded as Services revenue in prior periods. Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q7Table of Contents                                  Another change identified upon adoption was with respect to deferred contract costs, which include incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfill a contract. Deferred contract costs had been minimal under our prior practices as most costs to obtain a contract and fulfill a contract were expensed as incurred. However, as a result of the contract cost guidance included in ASC Topic 606 and ASC Topic 340-40 "Contracts with Customers", upon adoption, we recorded a transition asset of $153, and a net of tax increase of $117 to Retained earnings, related to the incremental cost to obtain contracts. Substantially all of this adjustment is related to the deferral of sales commissions paid to sales people and agents in connection with the placement of equipment with post sale service arrangements.The impacts of adopting ASC Topic 606 on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:  As of September 30, 2018  Superseded Revenue Guidance(1) Adjustments As ReportedDeferred tax assets $830 $(33) $797Other long-term assets 822 142 964Retained earnings 4,888 109 4,997____________(1)Reflects balance of account under revenue recognition guidance superseded by ASC Topic 606.Revenue Recognition Summary:We generate revenue through the sale of equipment, supplies and maintenance and printing services. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer or in the period the customer benefits from the service. With the exception of our sales-type lease arrangements, our invoices to the customer, which normally have short-term payment terms, are typically aligned to the transfer of goods or as services are rendered to our customers and therefore in most cases we recognize revenue based on our right to invoice customers. As a result of the application of this practical expedient for the substantial portion of our revenue, the disclosure of the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for our services is not required.Significant judgments primarily include the identification of performance obligations in our Document management services arrangements as well the pattern of delivery for those services. More specifically, revenue related to our products and services is generally recognized as follows:Equipment: Revenues from the sale of equipment directly to end customers, including those from sales-type leases (see below), are recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied and control has been transferred to the customer. For equipment placements that require us to install the product at the customer location, revenue is normally recognized when the equipment has been delivered and installed at the customer location. Sales of customer installable products are recognized upon shipment or receipt by the customer according to the customer's shipping terms. Revenue from the equipment performance obligation also includes certain analyst training services performed in connection with the installation or delivery of the equipment.Maintenance services: We provide maintenance agreements on our equipment that include service and supplies for which the customer may pay a base minimum plus a price-per-page charge for usage. In arrangements that include minimums, those minimums are normally set below the customer’s estimated page volumes and are not considered substantive. These agreements are sold as part of a bundled lease arrangement or through distributors and resellers.  We normally account for these maintenance agreements as a single performance obligation for printing services being delivered in a series with delivery being measured by usage as billed to the customer. Accordingly, revenue on these agreements are normally recognized as billed to the customer over the term of the agreements based on page volumes.  A substantial portion of our products are sold with full service maintenance agreements, accordingly, other than the product warranty obligations associated with certain of our entry level products, we do not have any significant warranty obligations, including any obligations under customer satisfaction programs. Document management services: Revenues associated with our document management services are generally recognized as printing services are rendered, which is generally on the basis of the number of images produced. Revenues on unit-price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices as work is completed by the customer. We account for these arrangements as a single performance obligation for printing services being delivered in a series with delivery being measured by usage as billed to the customer. Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q8Table of Contents                                  Our services contracts may also include the sale or lease of equipment and software. In these instances, we follow the policies noted for Equipment or Software Revenues and separately report the revenue associated with these performance obligations. Certain document management services arrangements may also include an embedded lease of equipment. In these instances, the revenues associated with the lease are recognized in accordance with the requirements for lease accounting. Sales to distributors and resellers: We utilize distributors and resellers to sell our equipment, supplies and maintenance services to end-user customers. We refer to our distributor and reseller network as our two-tier distribution model. Revenues on sales to distributors and resellers are generally recognized when products are shipped to such distributors and resellers. However, revenue is only recognized when the distributor or reseller has economic substance apart from the Company such that collectability is probable and we have no further obligations related to bringing about the resale, delivery or installation of the product that would impact transfer of control. Revenues associated with maintenance agreements sold through distributors and resellers to end customers are recognized in a consistent manner to maintenance services. Revenue that may be subject to a reversal of revenue due to contractual terms or uncertainties is not recorded as revenue until the contractual provisions lapse or the uncertainties are resolved. Distributors and resellers participate in various rebate, price-protection, cooperative marketing and other programs, and we estimate the variable consideration associated with these programs and record those amounts as a reduction to revenue when the sales occur. Similarly, we account for our estimates of sales returns and other allowances when the sales occur based on our historical experience.In certain instances, we may provide lease financing to end-user customers who purchased equipment we sold to distributors or resellers. We are not obligated to provide financing and we compete with other third-party leasing companies with respect to the lease financing provided to these end-user customers.Bundled Lease Arrangements: A significant portion of our direct sales of equipment to end customers are made through bundled lease arrangements, which typically include equipment, maintenance and financing components for which the customer pays a single negotiated fixed minimum monthly payment for all elements over the contractual lease term. These arrangements also typically include an incremental, variable component for page volumes in excess of contractual page volume minimums, which are often expressed in terms of price-per-page. The fixed minimum monthly payments are multiplied by the number of months in the contract term to arrive at the total fixed minimum payments that the customer is obligated to make (fixed payments) over the lease term. In applying our lease accounting methodology, we only consider the fixed payments for purposes of allocating to the relative fair value elements of the contract.Revenues under bundled arrangements are allocated considering the relative standalone selling prices of the lease and non-lease deliverables included in the bundled arrangement. Lease deliverables include the equipment, financing, maintenance and other executory costs, while non-lease deliverables generally consist of the supplies and non-maintenance services. The allocation for the lease deliverables begins by allocating revenues to the maintenance and other executory costs plus a profit thereon. These elements are generally recognized over the term of the lease as service revenue. The remaining amounts are allocated to the equipment and financing elements, which are subjected to the accounting estimates noted below under “Leases”.Leases: The two primary lease accounting provisions we assess for the classification of transactions as sales-type or operating leases are: (1) a review of the lease term to determine if it is equal to or greater than 75% of the economic life of the equipment and (2) a review of the present value of the minimum lease payments to determine if they are equal to or greater than 90% of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the lease. Equipment placements included in arrangements meeting these conditions are accounted for as sales-type leases and revenue is recognized as noted above for Equipment. Equipment placements included in arrangements that do not meet these conditions are accounted for as operating leases and revenue is recognized over the term of the lease. We consider the economic life of most of our products to be five years, since this represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our principal products and only a small percentage of our leases are for original terms longer than five years. There is no significant after-market for our used equipment. We believe five years is representative of the period during which the equipment is expected to be economically usable, with normal service, for the purpose for which it is intended. Residual values are not significant.With respect to fair value, we perform an analysis of equipment fair value based on cash selling prices during the applicable period. The cash selling prices are compared to the range of values determined for our leases. The range of cash selling prices must be reasonably consistent with the lease selling prices in order for us to determine that such lease prices are indicative of fair value.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q9Table of Contents                                  Our lease pricing interest rates, which are used in determining customer payments in a bundled lease arrangement, are developed based upon a variety of factors including local prevailing rates in the marketplace and the customer’s credit history, industry and credit class. We reassess our pricing interest rates quarterly based on changes in the local prevailing rates in the marketplace. These interest rates have generally been adjusted if the rates vary by 25 basis points or more, cumulatively, from the rate last in effect. The pricing interest rates generally equal the implicit rates within the leases, as corroborated by our comparisons of cash to lease selling prices.Software: Most of our equipment has both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the equipment's essential functionality and therefore they are accounted for together as part of Equipment sales revenues. Software accessories sold in connection with our Equipment sales, as well as free-standing software sales are accounted for as separate performance obligations if determined to be material in relation to the overall arrangement. Revenue from software is not a significant component of our Total revenues.Supplies: Supplies revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, generally upon utilization or shipment to the customer in accordance with the sales contract terms.Financing: Finance income attributable to sales-type leases, direct financing leases and installment loans is recognized on the accrual basis using the effective interest method.Revenues disaggregated by primary geographic markets, major product lines, and sales channels are as follows:  Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended                                           September 30,  2018 2017 2018 2017Primary geographical markets(1):        United States $1,414 $1,500 $4,307 $4,502Europe 587 628 1,923 1,942Canada 133 154 424 449Other 218 215 643 625Total Revenues $2,352 $2,497 $7,297 $7,518         Major product and services lines:        Equipment(2) $511 $520 $1,571 $1,569Supplies, paper and other sales 432 461 1,322 1,358Maintenance agreements(3) 587 624 1,854 1,925Service arrangements(4) 587 637 1,824 1,895Rental and other 170 182 522 548Financing 65 73 204 223Total Revenues $2,352 $2,497 $7,297 $7,518         Sales channels:        Direct equipment lease(5) $175 $165 $507 $488Distributors & resellers(6) 304 331 1,005 1,024Customer direct 464 485 1,381 1,415Total Sales $943 $981 $2,893 $2,927_____________(1)Geographic area data is based upon the location of the subsidiary reporting the revenue.(2)For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, Equipment sale revenues exclude $11 and $31, respectively, of equipment-related training revenue, which was classified as Services under previous revenue guidance - see "Adoption Summary" above. (3)Includes revenues from maintenance agreements on sold equipment as well as revenues associated with service agreements sold in our small and mid-sized business (SMB) focused channels and through our channel partners as Xerox Partner Print Services (XPPS).  (4)Primarily includes revenues from our Managed Document Services (MDS) offerings.  Also includes revenues from embedded operating leases, which were not significant.(5)Primarily reflects direct sales through bundled lease arrangements.(6)Primarily reflects sales through our two-tier distribution channels. Other Revenue Recognition PoliciesContract assets and liabilities:  We normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time. Our contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are primarily related to advanced billings for maintenance and other services to be performed and were approximately $108 and $91 at September 30, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively.  The majority of the balance at September 30, 2018 will be amortized to revenue over approximately the next 30 months.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q10Table of Contents                                  Contract Costs: Incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract primarily include sales commissions paid to sales people and agents in connection with the placement of equipment with associated post sale services arrangements. These costs are deferred and amortized on the straight-line basis over the estimated contract term, which is currently estimated to be approximately four years. We pay commensurate sales commissions upon customer renewals, therefore our amortization period is aligned to our initial contract term. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract of $22 and $62, respectively, were deferred and the related amortization was $24 and $72, respectively. The balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at September 30, 2018 was $174. This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately four years. We may also incur costs associated with our services arrangements to generate or enhance resources and assets that will be used to satisfy our future performance obligations included in these arrangements. These costs are considered contract fulfillment costs. These costs are amortized over the contractual service period of the arrangement to cost of services. In addition, we also provide inducements to certain customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. Amounts deferred associated with contract fulfillment costs and inducements were $10 at September 30, 2018.Equipment and software used in the fulfillment of service arrangements and where the Company retains control are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the term of the contract if an asset is contract specific.Revenue-based Taxes: Revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions, and that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. The primary revenue-based taxes are sales tax and value-added tax (VAT).Shipping and Handling: Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.Note 3 – Recent Accounting PronouncementsAccounting Standard Updates to be Adopted:LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, with additional amendments being issued in 2018. This update requires the recognition of right-to-use assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases under existing lease guidance.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. Short term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized. The update also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosure of key information regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among companies. The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change with this update except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance as well as to the new revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09. Some of these conforming changes such as those related to the definition of minimum lease payments, may potentially result in certain lease arrangements, which are currently accounted for as operating leases, being classified and accounted for as sales-type leases with a corresponding up-front recognition of equipment sales revenue.   This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019 and certain practical expedients can be elected upon adoption.  On the Lessee side, a cross-functional implementation team has been established which is evaluating the lease portfolio, system, process and policy change requirements. The Company has made progress in gathering the necessary data elements for the lease population and a system provider has been selected, with system configuration and implementation underway. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial results and expects it will have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position primarily related to the recognition of  previously off-book operating leases. The Company is currently planning to elect the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and is evaluating the other practical expedients available under the guidance. On the Lessor side, the Company continues to assess the potential impacts of the guidance on its lease agreements with customers, including potential changes in contracting terms, and we also expect to elect the package of practical expedients. The aggregate undiscounted value of our operating lease commitments at December 31, 2017 was approximately $450 and was primarily related to leases of facilities.  Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q11Table of Contents                                  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses and DerivativesIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets. The update impacts financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through Net income. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The amendments in this update expand and refine hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments with the same income statement line item that the hedged item is reported and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on our consolidated financial statements.Intangibles - Internal-Use Software In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.  This update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The update provides criteria for determining which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. The capitalized implementation costs are required to be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement. The update also clarifies the presentation requirements for reporting such costs in the entity’s financial statements. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-15 on our consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No, 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The update allows the reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive income to Retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") enacted in December 2017. Consequently, the update eliminates the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users. However, because the update only relates to the reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act, the underlying guidance that requires that the effect of a change in tax laws or rates be included in Income from continuing operations is not affected. The update also requires certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. The update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption of this update is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance.Accounting Standard Updates Adopted in 2018:Cash FlowsIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This update provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues where current guidance is either unclear or does not include specific requirements. We adopted ASU 2016-15 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. This update includes specific guidance, that requires cash collected on beneficial interests received in a sale of receivables be classified as inflows from investing activities. Formerly, those collections were reported in operating cash flows. We reported $60 and $170 of collections on beneficial interests as operating cash inflows on the Statement of Cash Flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Since the update is required to be applied retrospectively, our reported 2017 operating and investing cash flows were revised accordingly in 2018 to report this amount as investing cash flows. There is no expected impact to our 2018 cash flows from this reporting change, due to the termination of all accounts receivable sales arrangements in North America and all but one arrangement in Europe and the final repurchase of previously sold finance receivables during the fourth quarter of 2017. The other seven issues noted in this update did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q12Table of Contents                                  Additionally, in November 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash.  The update requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-18 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and applied it retrospectively through a revision of previously reported amounts. We held $61 and $75 of restricted cash, currently reported in Other current or long-term assets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The changes in our restricted cash balances were primarily related to our accounts receivable sales programs, which were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2017. Accordingly, this update did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 5 - Supplementary Financial Information for additional information.Retirement BenefitsIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This update changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans present net periodic benefit costs in the income statement. An employer is required to report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the affected employees during the period. Other components of net retirement benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of Income from operations, if one is presented. We elected to report these costs as a separate item within Other expenses, net. The update also allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization, when applicable. We adopted ASU 2017-07 effective for us beginning January 1, 2018. The presentation requirements of this update were required to be applied retrospectively through a revision of previously reported amounts. The requirement to limit capitalization to the service cost component was required to be applied prospectively. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 14 - Employee Benefit Plans for the service cost component and other components of net retirement benefit cost.The following table reflects the adjustment of selected lines from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income to the recasted amounts as a result of the adoption of this update:  Three Months Ended September 30, 2017  As      Reported Adjustment As        RecastedCost of sales $594 $(1) $593Cost of services, maintenance and rentals 882 (12) 870Research, development and engineering expenses 108 (3) 105Selling, administrative and general expenses 648 (18) 630Restructuring and related costs 36 (1) 35Other expenses, net 17 35 52  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017  As      Reported Adjustment As        RecastedCost of sales $1,780 $(3) $1,777Cost of services, maintenance and rentals 2,666 (43) 2,623Research, development and engineering expenses 332 (14) 318Selling, administrative and general expenses 1,955 (65) 1,890Restructuring and related costs 196 (4) 192Other expenses, net 105 129 234Business Combinations In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. We adopted ASU 2017-01 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, and the adoption did not have nor is it expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q13Table of Contents                                  Income TaxesIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.  This update requires recognition of the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Under current GAAP, recognition of the income tax consequences for asset transfers other than inventory could not be recognized until the asset was sold to a third party. We adopted ASU 2016-16 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have nor is it expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 118 (as further clarified by the FASB's ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118) to provide guidance for companies that may not have completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB No. 118 provides for a provisional one-year measurement period for entities to finalize their accounting for certain income tax effects related to the Tax Act. SAB No. 118 provides guidance where: (i) the accounting for the income tax effect of the Tax Act is complete and reported in the Tax Act's enactment period, (ii) the accounting for the income tax effect of the Tax Act is incomplete and reported as provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates (to the extent determinable) subject to adjustments during a limited measurement period until complete, and (iii) accounting for the income tax effect of the Tax Act is not reasonably estimable (no related provisional amounts are reported in the enactment period) and entities would continue to apply accounting based on tax law provisions in effect prior to the Tax Act enactment until provisional amounts are reasonably estimable. SAB No. 118 requires disclosure of the reasons for incomplete accounting additional information or analysis needed, among other relevant information. During the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded an estimated non-cash charge of $400 reflecting our provisional estimated impact associated with the provisions of the Tax Act based on currently available information. During third quarter 2018, we adjusted our provisional estimate by an additional charge of $95 reflecting certain positions taken on our recently filed 2017 income tax return as well as consideration of additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The adjustment includes changes to the determination of the one-time deemed repatriation tax as well as additional re-measurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted statutory tax rate. The total charge of $495 related to the Tax Act remains a provisional estimate as we continue to evaluate and consider additional impacts including those related to interpretive guidance from the U.S. Treasury and IRS as well as filing positions we may take on our 2018 U.S. Tax Return.  Accordingly, additional adjustments, possibly material, may be recorded in the fourth quarter 2018 as we finalize our estimate related to the Tax Act.  Any adjustments to this provisional amount will be reported as a component of Income tax expense.Other UpdatesIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, the FASB also issued the following Accounting Standards Updates, which did not have or are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption. Those updates are as follows:•Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General: ASU 2018-14, (Topic 715-20) Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.

The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is determined principally on the basis of past collection experience as well as consideration of current economic conditions and changes in our customer collection trends. Accounts Receivable Sales Arrangements Accounts receivable sales arrangements are utilized in the normal course of business as part of our cash and liquidity management. The accounts receivable sold are generally short-term trade receivables with payment due dates of less than 60 days. During the fourth quarter 2017, we terminated all accounts receivable sales arrangements in North America and all but one arrangement in Europe. The remaining facility in Europe enables us to sell accounts receivable associated with our distributor network on an ongoing basis, without recourse. Under this arrangement, we sell our entire interest in the related accounts receivable for cash and no portion of the payment is held back or deferred by the purchaser.Of the accounts receivable sold and derecognized from our balance sheet, $98 and $161 remained uncollected as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  Accounts receivable sales were as follows: Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended                                           September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017Accounts receivable sales(1)$66 $520 $297 $1,598Deferred proceeds— 56 — 164Loss on sales of accounts receivable1 3 2 9Estimated decrease to operating cash flows(2)(34) (77) (61) (83)__________________________(1)Customers may also enter into structured-payable arrangements that require us to sell our receivables from that customer to a third-party financial institution, which then makes payments to us to settle the customer's receivable. In these instances, we ensure the sale of the receivables are bankruptcy remote and the payment made to us is without recourse. The activity associated with these arrangements is not reflected in this disclosure as payments under these arrangements have not been material and these are customer directed arrangements.

Our finance receivable portfolios are primarily in the U.S., Canada and Europe. We generally establish customer credit limits and estimate the allowance for credit losses on a country or geographic basis. Our policy and methodology used to establish our allowance for doubtful accounts has been consistently applied over all periods presented.The following table is a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful finance receivables as well as the related investment in finance receivables:Allowance for Credit Losses: United States Canada Europe Other(1) TotalBalance at December 31, 2017 $56 $15 $35 $2 $108Provision 5 — 4 — 9Charge-offs (5) (1) (4) — (10)Recoveries and other(2) — — 1 — 1Balance at March 31, 2018 $56 $14 $36 $2 $108Provision 4 1 4 — 9Charge-offs (4) (1) (3) — (8)Recoveries and other(2) — — (2) — (2)Balance at June 30, 2018 $56 $14 $35 $2 $107Provision 2 — 4 — 6Charge-offs (2) (2) (4) — (8)Recoveries and other(2) 1 1 — — 2Balance at September 30, 2018 $57 $13 $35 $2 $107Finance receivables as of September 30, 2018 collectively evaluated for impairment (3) $1,950 $352 $1,242 $57 $3,601           Balance at December 31, 2016 $55 $16 $37 $2 $110Provision 4 — 5 — 9Charge-offs (6) (2) (2) — (10)Recoveries and other(2) — 2 — — 2Balance at March 31, 2017 $53 $16 $40 $2 $111Provision 4 1 1 — 6Charge-offs (10) (1) (3) — (14)Recoveries and other(2) 1 — 4 — 5Balance at June 30, 2017 $48 $16 $42 $2 $108Provision 1 — 3 — 4Charge-offs (2) (1) (3) — (6)Recoveries and other(2) 8 1 1 — 10Balance at September 30, 2017 $55 $16 $43 $2 $116Finance receivables as of September 30, 2017 collectively evaluated for impairment(3) $1,992 $391 $1,339 $66 $3,788 __________________(1)Includes developing market countries and smaller units.(2)Includes the impacts of foreign currency translation and adjustments to reserves necessary to reflect events of non-payment such as customer accommodations and contract terminations.(3)Total Finance receivables exclude the allowance for credit losses of $107 and $116 at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q18Table of Contents                                  We evaluate our customers based on the following credit quality indicators:•Investment grade: This rating includes accounts with excellent to good business credit, asset quality and capacity to meet financial obligations. These customers are less susceptible to adverse effects due to shifts in economic conditions or changes in circumstance. The rating generally equates to a Standard & Poor's (S&P) rating of BBB- or better. Loss rates in this category are normally less than 1%.•Non-investment grade: This rating includes accounts with average credit risk that are more susceptible to loss in the event of adverse business or economic conditions. This rating generally equates to a BB S&P rating. Although we experience higher loss rates associated with this customer class, we believe the risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that our leases are fairly well dispersed across a large and diverse customer base. In addition, the higher loss rates are largely offset by the higher rates of return we obtain with such leases. Loss rates in this category are generally in the range of 2% to 5%.•Substandard: This rating includes accounts that have marginal credit risk such that the customer’s ability to make repayment is impaired or may likely become impaired. We use numerous strategies to mitigate risk including higher rates of interest, prepayments, personal guarantees, etc. Accounts in this category include customers who were downgraded during the term of the lease from investment and non-investment grade evaluation when the lease was originated. Accordingly, there is a distinct possibility for a loss of principal and interest or customer default. The loss rates in this category are generally in the range of 7% to 10%.Credit quality indicators are updated at least annually and the credit quality of any given customer can change during the life of the portfolio.

These adjustments may result in recorded equity income (loss) that is different from that implied by our 25% ownership interest. In addition, the Equity in net income (loss) of Fuji Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 includes after-tax restructuring and other charges of $7 and $90, respectively. In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, out-of-period adjustments and misstatements were identified. These adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and were incremental to the items that had been identified by the IIC (or Fujifilm's independent investigation committee completed in June 2017). These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments. In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries where previous misstatements were identified. Fuji Xerox recorded a cumulative charge of JPY 12 billion (approximately $110 based on the Yen/U.S. Dollar average exchange rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of 108.07) in their net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (our first quarter 2018) related to the correction of these adjustments and misstatements. Our recognition of 25% of Fuji Xerox’s net loss for Xerox’s first quarter 2018 included an approximately $28 charge related to these adjustments and misstatements. We determined that the impact of the out-of-period misstatements was not material to Xerox’s consolidated financial statements for any individual prior quarter or year and the adjustment to correct the misstatements is not expected to be material to our full year 2018 results. Summarized financial information for Fuji Xerox was as follows: Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended                                           September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017Summary of Operations       Revenues$2,326 $2,508 $7,017 $7,392Costs and expenses2,077 2,383 6,946 6,926Income before Income Taxes249 125 71 466Income tax expense84 41 95 117Net Income (Loss)165 84 (24) 349Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests1 1 2 3Net Income (Loss) – Fuji Xerox$164 $83 $(26) $346Weighted Average Exchange Rate(1)111.43 110.90 109.50 111.92_____________________________(1)Represents Yen/U.S. Dollar exchange rate used to translate.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q21Table of Contents                                  Note 10 – Restructuring ProgramsDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $91, which included $104 of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 1,850 employees worldwide and $13 of lease cancellation costs. These costs were partially offset by $26 of net reversals, primarily resulting from changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.Information related to restructuring program activity is outlined below: Severance andRelated Costs Lease Cancellationand Other Costs Asset Impairments(2) TotalBalance at December 31, 2017$108 $1 $— $109Provision24 12 — 36Reversals(8) — — (8)Net current period charges(1)16 12 — 28Charges against reserve and currency(41) (11) — (52)Balance at March 31, 2018$83 $2 $— $85Provision40 — — 40Reversals(6) — — (6)Net current period charges(1)34 — — 34Charges against reserve and currency(39) (1) — (40)Balance at June 30, 2018$78 $1 $— $79Provision40 1 — 41Reversals(12) — — (12)Net current period charges(1)28 1 — 29Charges against reserve and currency(37) (1) — (38)Balance at September 30, 2018$69 $1 $— $70____________________________(1)Represents net amount recognized within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the period shown for restructuring and asset impairment charges.(2)Charges associated with asset impairments represent the write-down of the related assets to their new cost basis and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of the provision.The following table summarizes the reconciliation to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended                                           September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017Charges against reserve and currency$(38) $(38) $(130) $(154)Effects of foreign currency and other non-cash items(1) (3) — (11)Restructuring cash payments$(39) $(41) $(130) $(165) Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q22Table of Contents                                  Note 11 – DebtBridge FacilityRefer to Note 20 - Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments for additional information regarding the bridge loan facility that was terminated during the second quarter of 2018.

These derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges depending on the nature of the risk being hedged.Fair Value Hedges As of September 30, 2018, pay variable/receive fixed interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $300 and net liability fair value of $6 were designated and accounted for as fair value hedges. The swaps were structured to hedge the fair value of related debt by converting them from fixed rate instruments to variable rate instruments. No ineffective portion was recorded to earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The following is a summary of our fair value hedges at September 30, 2018: Debt Instrument Year First Designated Notional Amount Net Fair Value Weighted Average Interest Rate Paid Interest Rate Received Basis MaturitySenior Note 2021 2014 $300 $(6) 3.03% 4.5% Libor 2021Foreign Exchange Risk ManagementWe are a global company that is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business. As a part of our foreign exchange risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts and purchased option contracts, to hedge the following foreign currency exposures, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and liabilities:•Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities•Forecasted purchases and sales in foreign currencyAt September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of $1,200 and $1,788 respectively, with terms of less than 12 months. Approximately 78% of the contracts at September 30, 2018 mature within three months, 11% mature in three to six months and 11% in six to twelve months. The associated currency exposures being hedged at September 30, 2018 were materially consistent with our year-end currency exposures, with the exception of our U.S. Dollar/Euro exposure, which decreased $288, and our Euro/U.K. Pound Sterling exposure, which decreased $128. There has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.Foreign Currency Cash Flow HedgesWe designate a portion of our foreign currency derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of our foreign currency-denominated inventory purchases, sales and expenses. The net liability fair value of these contracts were $6 and $14 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q23Table of Contents                                  Summary of Derivative Instruments Fair ValueThe following table provides a summary of the fair value amounts of our derivative instruments: Designation of Derivatives Balance Sheet Location September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments    Foreign exchange contracts - forwards Other current assets $1 $1  Other current liabilities (8) (15)Foreign currency options Other current assets 1 —  Other current liabilities — —Interest rate swaps Other long-term assets — 1  Other long-term liabilities (6) —  Net designated derivative liability $(12) $(13)       Derivatives NOT Designated as Hedging Instruments    Foreign exchange contracts – forwards Other current assets $1 $1  Other current liabilities (8) (10)  Net undesignated derivative liability $(7) $(9)       Summary of Derivatives Total Derivative Assets $3 $3  Total Derivative Liabilities (22) (25)  Net Derivative liability $(19) $(22)Summary of Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)Derivative gains (losses) affect the income statement based on whether such derivatives are designated as hedges of underlying exposures.

In addition, no amount was recorded for an underlying exposure that did not occur or was not expected to occur.As of September 30, 2018, a net after-tax loss of $7 was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedging activity. The entire balance is expected to be reclassified into Net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.Non-Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)Non-designated derivative instruments are primarily instruments used to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. They are not designated as hedges since there is a natural offset for the re-measurement of the underlying foreign currency-denominated asset or liability.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q24Table of Contents                                  The following table provides a summary of gains (losses) on non-designated derivative instruments:Derivatives NOT Designated as Hedging Instruments   Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended                                           September 30,Location of Derivative Gain (Loss) 2018 2017 2018 2017Foreign exchange contracts – forwards Other expense – Currency (loss) gain, net $(7) $(20) $11 $(30)For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 currency losses, net were $3 and $2, respectively.

The basis for the measurement at fair value in all cases is Level 2 – Significant Other Observable Inputs.  September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Assets:   Foreign exchange contracts - forwards$2 $2Foreign currency options1 —Interest rate swaps— 1Deferred compensation investments in mutual funds17 18Total$20 $21Liabilities:   Foreign exchange contracts - forwards$16 $25Foreign currency options— —Interest rate swaps6 —Deferred compensation plan liabilities18 19Total$40 $44We utilize the income approach to measure the fair value for our derivative assets and liabilities. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates and forward prices, and therefore are classified as Level 2.Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for those funds. Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment selections.Summary of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities The estimated fair values of our other financial assets and liabilities were as follows: September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 CarryingAmount FairValue CarryingAmount FairValueCash and cash equivalents$1,157 $1,157 $1,293 $1,293Accounts receivable, net1,290 1,290 1,357 1,357Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt410 409 282 283Long-term debt4,815 4,770 5,235 5,373The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2). The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q25Table of Contents                                  Note 14 – Employee Benefit Plans The components of Net periodic benefit cost and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Pension Benefits     U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Retiree HealthComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Costs:2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017Service cost$1 $— $6 $5 $2 $2Interest cost35 31 37 43 5 7Expected return on plan assets(35) (35) (60) (57) — —Recognized net actuarial loss5 5 14 20 — —Amortization of prior service credit— — (1) (1) (1) (1)Recognized settlement loss34 23 — — — —Defined benefit plans40 24 (4) 10 6 8Defined contribution plans(1)9 9 8 8 n/a n/aNet Periodic Benefit Cost49 33 4 18 6 8            Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income:           Net actuarial loss (gain)(2)— 50 (53) — — —Amortization of net actuarial loss(39) (28) (14) (21) — (1)Amortization of prior service credit— — 1 1 1 1Total Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income(3)(39) 22 (66) (20) 1 —Total Recognized in Net Periodic Benefit Cost and Other Comprehensive Income$10 $55 $(62) $(2) $7 $8 Nine Months Ended September 30, Pension Benefits     U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Retiree HealthComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Costs:2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017Service cost$2 $2 $19 $20 $4 $4Interest cost102 97 114 120 18 21Expected return on plan assets(105) (96) (185) (164) — —Recognized net actuarial loss17 16 44 58 — —Amortization of prior service credit(1) (1) (3) (3) (3) (3)Recognized settlement loss85 84 — — — —Defined benefit plans100 102 (11) 31 19 22Defined contribution plans(1)28 29 22 22 n/a n/aNet Periodic Benefit Cost128 131 11 53 19 22            Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income:           Net actuarial (gain) loss(2)(46) 70 (53) — 10 (11)Amortization of net actuarial loss(102) (100) (44) (59) — (1)Amortization of prior service credit1 1 3 3 3 3Total Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income(3)(147) (29) (94) (56) 13 (9)Total Recognized in Net Periodic Benefit Cost and Other Comprehensive Income$(19) $102 $(83) $(3) $32 $13__________(1)Prior year amounts have been revised to reflect additional cost for previously excluded plans.

This negative plan amendment is expected to result in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $280, which consists of approximately $215 for the plan amendment and an actuarial gain of approximately $65 related to the required plan remeasurement upon amendment. The amount for the plan amendment is expected to be amortized to future net periodic benefit costs as a prior service credit and is expected to reduce 2019 costs by approximately $70 (approximately $15 for the fourth quarter of 2018).  The plan amendment is also expected to reduce 2019 cash contributions from Xerox by approximately $20.Contributions The following table summarizes cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans.   Nine Months Ended                                           September 30, Year Ended                            December 31,   2018 2017 Estimated      2018 2017U.S. plans $20 $668 $26 $675Non-U.S. plans 91 49 116 161Total Pension $111 $717 $142 $836         Retiree Health $42 $49 $62 $64There are no mandatory contributions required in 2018 for our U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plans to meet the minimum funding requirements,  and our estimated 2018 contributions no longer include $50 of voluntary contributions to these plans.Note 15 – Stock-Based Compensation(share data in thousands)We have a long-term incentive plan whereby eligible employees may be granted restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares (PSs) and/or stock options (SOs). We grant stock-based compensation awards in order to continue to attract and retain qualified employees and to better align employees' interests with those of our shareholders. Each of these awards is subject to settlement with newly issued shares of our common stock.Stock-based compensation expense was as follows:   Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,  2018 2017 2018 2017Stock-based compensation expense, pre-tax $15 $14 $44 $39Income tax benefit recognized in earnings 4 5 11 15The following is a summary of changes to our program design and performance metrics effective for our April 2018 grant and grants thereafter under our new program, as approved by our board of directors (the "Board"). The Board also approved a change in the timing of our annual grant of awards from July to April, to better align our grant date with other annual incentive compensation payments and the underlying performance period related to PSs. We grant RSUs and PSs to officers, selected executives and middle managers, and SOs to officers and selected executives only.Restricted Stock UnitsCompensation expense for RSUs is based upon the grant date market price and is recognized on a straight-line basis over a three-year graded-vesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of shares expected to vest. RSUs vest on a graded schedule as follows: 25% after one year of service, 25% after two years of service, and 50% after three years of service from the date of grant. Prior to the April 2018 grant, RSUs vested on a three-year cliff basis from the date of grant. Shares awarded to employees who are retirement-eligible at the date of grant, become retirement-eligible during the vesting period, or are terminated not-for-cause (e.g. as part of a restructuring initiative), vest based on service provided from the date of grant to the date of separation on a pro-rata share of each individual graded-Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q27Table of Contents                                  vesting tranche. Shares granted through September 30, 2018 under our new program were 1,130, with a corresponding weighted average grant date fair value of $27.61 per share.  Performance SharesIn connection with the April 2018 grant, the Board approved the following changes to the PS performance goals: the Earnings Per Share (EPS) metric was replaced with a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) metric and the Cash Flow from Operations metric was replaced with a Free Cash Flow metric. The Board retained the Revenue metric as a performance goal as well as the three-year performance period for all measures. The performance metrics are equally weighted; accordingly, each PS grant is two-thirds performance based (revenue and free cash flow) and one-third market-based (TSR). The performance goals are independent of each other and depending on the achievement of these metrics, a recipient of a PS award is entitled to receive a number of shares equal to a percentage, ranging from 0% to 200% of the PS award granted. PSs retain the three-year cliff vesting from the date of grant. Performance-Based ComponentPSs vest contingent upon meeting pre-determined cumulative goals for revenue and free cash flow. The fair value of the performance-based component of our PSs is based upon the grant-date market price. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of shares expected to vest. If the cumulative three-year actual results exceed the stated targets, all plan participants have the potential to earn additional shares of common stock up to a maximum overachievement of 100% of the original grant. If the stated targets are not met, any recognized compensation cost would be reversed. Shares granted through September 30, 2018 under our new program were 693, with a corresponding weighted average grant date fair value of $27.88 per share.As a result of the change in management in the second quarter 2018, the Board is currently reviewing this plan and has not finalized the performance measures and corresponding weightings and therefore the plan remains discretionary as of the third quarter 2018. Since final performance measures have not been approved as of September 30, 2018, the criteria needed to establish a grant date has not been met and therefore the fair value of the April 2018 grant will continue to be revalued based on the period end stock price for each subsequent reporting period until the grant date criteria has been met.Market-Based ComponentThe TSR metric is based on the percentage change in the Company’s stock price plus the dividends paid over the three-year measurement period. Payout for this portion of the PS will be determined based on Xerox’s percentage change compared to the shareholder returns of the peer group of companies approved by the compensation committee of the Board (as disclosed in the 2018 annual proxy statement). Since the TSR portion of the PS award represents a market condition, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the grant-date fair value. A summary of the key valuation input assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation relative to PS awards granted were as follows:  Program to Date September 30, 2018Term 3 yearsRisk-free interest rate(1) 2.39%Dividend yield(2) 3.24%Xerox’s historical volatility(3) 29.12%Weighted average fair value(4) $32.03____________(1)The risk-free interest rate was based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield curve from the valuation date, with a maturity matched to the TSR performance period.(2)The dividend yield was calculated as the expected quarterly dividend divided by Xerox’s three-month average stock price as of the valuation date.(3)Xerox’s historical volatility is calculated from daily stock returns over a three-year look-back term from the valuation date.(4)The weighted average of fair values used to record compensation expense as determined by the Monte Carlo simulation.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q28Table of Contents                                  Our TSR compared to the peer group TSR will determine the payout as follows:Percentile Payout as a Percent of Target(1)80th and above 200%50th 100%25th 35%Below 25th 0%____________(1)For performance between the levels described above, the degree of vesting is interpolated on a linear basis.Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value determined by the Monte Carlo simulation and, except in cases of employee forfeiture, cannot be reversed regardless of performance. Shares granted through September 30, 2018 under our new program were 346.Stock OptionsThe Board also approved the granting of SOs as part of the 2018 plan design. Except for the conversion of options relating to our acquisition of Affiliated Computer Systems in 2010, we have not issued any SOs since 2004. Compensation expense associated with SOs is based upon the grant date fair value determined by utilizing the Black-Scholes (BS) option-pricing model and is recorded on a straight-line basis over a three-year graded-vesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of SOs expected to vest. SOs vest on a graded schedule as follows: 25% after one year of service, 25% after two years of service, and 50% after three years of service from the date of grant. Similar to RSUs, SOs awarded to employees who are retirement-eligible at the date of grant, become retirement-eligible during the vesting period, or are terminated not-for-cause, vest based on service provided from the date of grant to separation, on a pro-rata share of each individual vesting tranche. The weighted average assumptions used in the BS option-pricing model relative to SO awards were as follows:   Program to Date September 30, 2018Expected term(1) 6.13 yearsExpected volatility(2) 27.25%Expected dividend yield(3) 3.25%Risk-free interest rate(4) 2.63%Weighted average fair value(5) $5.71____________(1)Since these SO grants are effectively part of a new program, the expected term was calculated using the "Simplified Method” under the SEC guidance based on the SOs vesting schedule and contractual term. We did not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate an expected term.(2)The expected volatility was calculated based on a combination of Xerox's term-matched historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options.(3)The dividend yield was calculated as the expected quarterly dividend divided by Xerox’s three-month average stock price as of the grant date.(4)The risk-free interest rate was based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield curve with a maturity matched to the expected term of the SOs. (5)The weighted average of fair values used to record compensation expense as determined by the BS option-pricing model. SOs granted through September 30, 2018 under our new program were 1,379.Note: Management’s estimate of the number of shares expected to vest at the time of grant reflects an estimate for forfeitures based on our historical forfeiture rate to date. Should actual forfeitures differ from management’s estimate, the activity will be reflected in a subsequent period.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q29Table of Contents                                  Note 16 – Shareholders’ Equity(share data in thousands) CommonStock AdditionalPaid-inCapital Treasury Stock RetainedEarnings  AOCL(3) XeroxShareholders’Equity Non-controllingInterests TotalEquityBalance at June 30, 2018$255 $3,920 $— $4,974 $(3,772) $5,377 $31 $5,408Comprehensive income, net— — — 89 61 150 4 154Cash dividends declared - common(1)— — — (62) — (62) — (62)Cash dividends declared - preferred(2)— — — (4) — (4) — (4)Stock option and incentive plans, net1 10 — — — 11 — 11Payments to acquire treasury stock, including fees— — (284) — — (284) — (284)Distributions to noncontrolling interests— — — — — — (1) (1)Balance at September 30, 2018$256 $3,930 $(284) $4,997 $(3,711) $5,188 $34 $5,222 CommonStock AdditionalPaid-inCapital Treasury Stock RetainedEarnings  AOCL(3) XeroxShareholders’Equity Non-controllingInterests TotalEquityBalance at June 30, 2017$254 $3,875 $— $5,004 $(4,010) $5,123 $35 $5,158Comprehensive income, net— — — 179 115 294 3 297Cash dividends declared - common(1)— — — (63) — (63) — (63)Cash dividends declared - preferred(2)— — — (4) — (4) — (4)Stock option and incentive plans, net1 6 — — — 7 — 7Distributions and purchase - noncontrolling interests— (1) — — — (1) (4) (5)Balance at September 30, 2017$255 $3,880 $— $5,116 $(3,895) $5,356 $34 $5,390 CommonStock AdditionalPaid-inCapital Treasury Stock RetainedEarnings  AOCL(3) XeroxShareholders’Equity Non-controllingInterests TotalEquityBalance at December 31, 2017$255 $3,893 $— $4,856 $(3,748) $5,256 $37 $5,293Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles(4)— — — 120 — 120 — 120Comprehensive income, net— — — 224 37 261 9 270Cash dividends declared - common(1)— — — (192) — (192) — (192)Cash dividends declared - preferred(2)— — — (11) — (11) — (11)Stock option and incentive plans, net1 37 — — — 38 — 38Payments to acquire treasury stock, including fees— — (284) — — (284) — (284)Distributions to noncontrolling interests— — — — — — (12) (12)Balance at September 30, 2018$256 $3,930 $(284) $4,997 $(3,711) $5,188 $34 $5,222Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q30Table of Contents                                   CommonStock AdditionalPaid-inCapital Treasury Stock RetainedEarnings AOCL(3) XeroxShareholders’Equity Non-controllingInterests TotalEquityBalance at December 31, 2016$254 $3,858 $— $4,934 $(4,337) $4,709 $38 $4,747Comprehensive income, net— — — 385 442 827 10 837Cash dividends declared - common(1)— — — (192) — (192) — (192)Cash dividends declared - preferred(2)— — — (11) — (11) — (11)Stock option and incentive plans, net1 23 — — — 24 — 24Distributions and purchase - noncontrolling interests— (1) — — — (1) (14) (15)Balance at September 30, 2017$255 $3,880 $— $5,116 $(3,895) $5,356 $34 $5,390_____________________________(1)Cash dividends declared on common stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $0.25 per share and $0.75 per share, respectively.

We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.Brazil Tax and Labor ContingenciesOur Brazilian operations are involved in various litigation matters and have received or been the subject of numerous governmental assessments related to indirect and other taxes, as well as disputes associated with former employees and contract labor. The tax matters, which comprise a significant portion of the total contingencies, principally relate to claims for taxes on the internal transfer of inventory, municipal service taxes on rentals and gross revenue taxes. We are disputing these tax matters and intend to vigorously defend our positions. Based on the opinion of legal counsel and current reserves for those matters deemed probable of loss, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.The labor matters principally relate to claims made by former employees and contract labor for the equivalent payment of all social security and other related labor benefits, as well as consequential tax claims, as if they were regular employees. As of September 30, 2018, the total amounts related to the unreserved portion of the tax and labor contingencies, inclusive of any related interest, amounted to approximately $490, with the decrease from our December 31, 2017 balance of approximately $600, primarily related to currency and closed cases, partially offset by interest. With respect to the unreserved balance of approximately $490, the majority has been assessed by management as being remote as to the likelihood of ultimately resulting in a loss to the Company. In connection with the above proceedings, customary local regulations may require us to make escrow cash deposits or post other security of up to half of the total amount in dispute. As of September 30, 2018, we had $59 of escrow cash deposits for matters we are disputing and additional surety bonds and letters of credit of $87 and $108, respectively, which include associated indexation. There were no liens on any of our Brazilian assets as of September 30, 2018. Generally, any escrowed amounts would be refundable and any liens would be removed to the extent the matters are resolved in our favor. We routinely assess all these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability against our Brazilian operations and record our best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of an ultimate loss as probable.Litigation Against the CompanyPending Litigation Relating to the Fuji Transaction:  1.Deason v. Fujifilm Holdings Corp., et al.; Deason v. Xerox Corp., et al.; In re Xerox Corporation Consolidated Shareholder Litigation:In February 2018, five complaints, including four putative class actions (which have been consolidated), were filed by Xerox shareholders in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County ("Court") in connection with the proposed transaction to combine Xerox and Fuji Xerox (“Fuji Transaction”) (refer to Note 20 - Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments). All of the complaints name as defendants Xerox, its directors, and FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”). The complaint in one of the actions also names as a defendant Ursula M. Burns, the former Chief Executive Officer of Xerox. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that Xerox's directors breached their fiduciary duties in negotiating, approving, and purportedly making false and misleading disclosures about the Fuji Transaction, and that Fujifilm aided and abetted those breaches. The complaint in one of the actions further alleges that Xerox and the director defendants engaged in common law fraud by purportedly failing to disclose information about the joint venture agreements between Xerox and Fujifilm. The lawsuits seek injunctive relief preventing the previously proposed transactions, and/or additional disclosures by Xerox’s directors, unspecified damages from Xerox’s directors, costs and attorneys’ fees, as well as other relief.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q34Table of Contents                                  Another complaint filed by Darwin Deason, a Xerox shareholder, against Xerox and its directors in the same Court on March 2, 2018 alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by refusing Mr. Deason’s request for a waiver of the deadline for nomination of a new slate of Xerox directors, and sought to enjoin Xerox and its directors from enforcing Xerox’s advance notice by-laws, thereby allowing Mr. Deason to proceed with the nominations, as well as costs, fees, and other relief.On April 27, 2018, the Court issued decisions and orders granting plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions, which (i) enjoin Xerox from “taking any further action to consummate the change of control transaction between Xerox and Fuji that was announced on January 31, 2018 pending a final determination of the claims asserted in the underlying action;” (ii) enjoin Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw provision requiring shareholders to nominate directors for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting by December 11, 2017; and (iii) require Xerox to waive such advance notice bylaw provision to permit the noticing of a slate of director nominees for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, and denying defendants’ motions to dismiss.On May 1, 2018, Xerox entered into a Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, among others, that would have resolved the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as well as the ongoing litigation brought by Mr. Deason against Xerox and its directors related to the Fuji Transaction. The agreement expired by its terms on May 3, 2018 without becoming effective.On May 7, 2018, defendants filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, notices of appeal of, and motions to stay pending appeal, the lower Court’s decision and order.  Defendants also moved the appellate court for interim relief ordering that the appeal be heard on an expedited basis.  At a hearing before the appellate court on May 7, 2018, the appellate court ruled that the appeals would be heard on an expedited basis and granted a partial interim stay allowing Xerox and Fujifilm to take steps to seek regulatory approvals related to the Fuji Transaction pending a ruling from the appellate court on defendants’ motions to stay pending appeal.On May 13, 2018, a settlement agreement with respect to the Deason cases was signed on behalf of plaintiff Deason, the Icahn Group and related parties, and all defendants except Fujifilm, and a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of the putative class case was signed by all defendants except Fujifilm. Pursuant to the settlements, the settling defendants withdrew their appeal and motion to stay in the Deason cases.  The settling defendants also withdrew their motion to stay in the putative class case. Fujifilm's appeal and motion for a stay of the proceedings in the first Deason case and the putative class case remain pending before the Appellate Division.  The Court entered a stipulation of discontinuance as to the settling parties in the second Deason case on May 14, 2018, and agreed on June 22, 2018 to do the same in the first Deason case.  On June 14, 2018, Fujifilm filed answers in the first Deason case and the putative class case, along with cross-claims against the members of the Xerox Board (as constituted before May 13, 2018) and a third-party complaint against Xerox director Jonathan Christodoro, seeking contribution for any potential award against Fujifilm for aiding and abetting purported breaches of fiduciary duties.On June 19, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a stipulation of settlement that would resolve the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the putative class case against all defendants, other than Fujifilm.  Carmen Ribbe, the plaintiff in the below derivative action, and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the motion on July 10, 2018.  On June 22, 2018, the Court entered an order denying a joint motion by the putative class plaintiffs and the settling defendants to dissolve the injunction in the class case as against the settling defendants, and entered an order denying Fujifilm’s motion to dissolve the injunctions in the class case and the first Deason case in their entirety.On July 16, 2018, the Court held a hearing concerning the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in the putative class case. The Court indicated that it was not inclined to consider motions for approval of the settlement prior to considering whether the putative class should be certified.On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders recognizing the Xerox defendants’ withdrawal of their appeal in the Deason cases and denying all appellants’ motions to stay pending determination of appeals in the Deason and class cases.On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders (i) at their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’ appeal and motion to stay in the Deason cases; and (ii) upon their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’ motion to stay, pending determination of appeal, the putative class case; and (iii) denying Fujifilm’s motion to stay pending determination of its appeals in the Deason and putative case cases.On September 21, 2018, putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of a settlement class and a motion to transmit notice of the proposed settlement to the proposed class.  On October 17, 2018, derivative plaintiff Carmen Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q35Table of Contents                                  Ribbe and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class. The class has not yet been certified, and preliminary approval has not been granted.The Appellate Division heard oral argument on September 25, 2018 on Fujifilm’s appeal of the Court’s decision.  On October 16, 2018, the Appellate Division entered a decision and order reversing the Court’s rulings, ordering that the claims brought against Fujifilm in the cases by Mr. Deason and the purported class be dismissed, and further ordering that the preliminary injunction of the proposed Fuji Transaction be dissolved.Xerox will vigorously defend these lawsuits to the extent that the proceedings continue as to Xerox. At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in these lawsuits. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.2.Ribbe v. Jacobson, et al.:  On May 24, 2018, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed with the Court by Carmen Ribbe against all defendants in the putative class action described above, as well as Centerview Partners, LLC.  Plaintiff made no pre-complaint demand.  The Ribbe complaint contains allegations of breaches of fiduciary duty similar to those in the putative class complaint, and further alleges that Fujifilm and Centerview aided and abetted those breaches, and that the directors breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets by, among other things, agreeing to releases of claims against them and allowing certain alleged payments in settlement of the Deason and putative class cases.  It seeks unspecified damages for Xerox, rescission or reformation of the Deason and putative class settlements, restitution of funds allegedly paid to the directors, injunctive relief against wrongful practices, costs and attorneys’ fees, as well as other relief.  On August 13, 2018, the Xerox defendants and Fujifilm filed motions to dismiss or stay the complaint.  The motions are fully briefed.On or about August 10, 2018, the parties filed a stipulated proposed order of discontinuance without prejudice as to Centerview in light of a recent agreement between Centerview and Xerox. On August 27, 2018, the Court declined to so-order the discontinuance absent Xerox’s providing notice thereof to shareholders, and ordered the parties to confer regarding notice publication.Xerox believes the lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend it. At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.3.Fujifilm Holdings Corp. v. Xerox Corporation:  On June 18, 2018, Fujifilm filed a complaint against Xerox in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, relating to the Fuji Transaction agreements. The complaint alleges that Xerox (1) willfully breached the Fuji Transaction agreements by purporting to terminate them to appease Messrs. Icahn and Deason and using as a pretext issues with Fujifilm’s untimely submitted financials, and by settling the Deason litigation without notice to or consent by Fujifilm; (2) willfully breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to support and use best efforts to conclude the Fuji Transaction, thus depriving Fujifilm of the benefit of its bargain; and (3) effected a change in Xerox’s recommendation regarding the Fuji Transaction, entitling Fujifilm to terminate the Fuji Transaction agreements and to receive from Xerox a $183 termination fee. Fujifilm seeks a judgment for damages to be determined at trial in an amount in excess of $1.0 billion plus punitive damages; a declaration regarding the alleged change in recommendation such that Fujifilm may terminate the transaction and Xerox must pay the $183 termination fee and other remedies; costs and attorneys’ fees; and other relief the court may deem appropriate. At a conference on September 24, 2018, the Court stayed all discovery pending resolution of Xerox’s motion to dismiss.  Xerox filed its motion to dismiss on October 1, 2018.Xerox believes the lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend it. At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q36Table of Contents                                  State of Texas v. Xerox Corporation, Xerox State Healthcare, LLC, and ACS State Healthcare, LLC: On May 9, 2014, the State of Texas, via the Texas Office of Attorney General (the “State”), filed a lawsuit in the 53rd Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas. The lawsuit alleges that Xerox Corporation, Xerox State Healthcare, LLC and ACS State Healthcare (collectively “the Defendants”) violated the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act in the administration of ACS State Healthcare’s contract with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (“HHSC”). Xerox Corporation provided a guaranty of contractual performance with respect to the ACS State Healthcare’s contract. The State alleges that the Defendants made false representations of material facts regarding the processes, procedures, implementation and results regarding the prior authorization of orthodontic claims. The State seeks recovery of actual damages, two times the amount of any overpayments made as a result of unlawful acts, civil penalties, pre- and post-judgment interest and all costs and attorneys’ fees. The State references the amount in controversy as exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. The Defendants filed their Answer in June 2014 denying all allegations. In August 2017, the State of Texas filed a Second Amended Petition, which makes substantially similar allegations and seeks similar remedies as the original lawsuit. On October 23, 2017, Xerox Corporation filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking judgment in Xerox's favor on all claims against it. On July 2, 2018, the Court denied the State of Texas’ motion for a determination of the adequacy of its pleadings as to Xerox or in the alternative, seeking leave to amend its petition to bring additional claims against Xerox. The Defendants will continue to vigorously defend themselves in this matter. This matter is a “Conduent Liability”, as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement dated as of December 31, 2016 between Xerox Corporation and Conduent Incorporated, for which Conduent is required to indemnify Xerox. Conduent is entitled to direct the defense of this matter.Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System v. Xerox Corporation, Ursula M. Burns, Luca Maestri, Kathryn A. Mikells, Lynn R. Blodgett, Robert K. Zapfel, David H. Bywater and Mary Scanlon: On October 21, 2016, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System (“plaintiff”) filed a purported securities class action complaint against Xerox Corporation, Ursula Burns, Luca Maestri, Kathryn Mikells, Lynn Blodgett and Robert Zapfel (collectively, “defendants”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of the plaintiff and certain purchasers or acquirers of Xerox common stock. The complaint alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, relating to the operations and prospects of Xerox’s Health Enterprise business. Plaintiff sought, among other things, unspecified monetary damages and attorneys’ fees. Other, similar lawsuits may follow. On December 28, 2016, the Court entered a stipulated order setting out a schedule for amendment of the complaint and for defendants’ response to that complaint following the Court’s appointment of lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. On February 28, 2017, the Court issued an opinion and order appointing the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System ("APERS") as lead plaintiff. On May 1, 2017, APERS filed an amended complaint, alleging substantially similar claims and seeking substantially similar relief, but adding David Bywater and Mary Scanlon as defendants. On June 30, 2017, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and the motions were fully briefed on October 13, 2017. On March 20, 2018, the Court entered an opinion and order granting the motions, and on March 23, 2018, the Court entered a judgment of dismissal and closed the case. On April 20, 2018, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Xerox will vigorously defend against this matter. At this time, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.Other ContingenciesWe have issued or provided approximately $320 of guarantees as of September 30, 2018 in the form of letters of credit or surety bonds issued to i) support certain insurance programs; ii) support our obligations related to the Brazil tax and labor contingencies; and iii) support certain contracts, primarily with public sector customers, which require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations.In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote. We believe that our capacity in the surety markets as well as under various credit arrangements (including our Credit Facility) is sufficient to allow us to respond to future requests for proposals that require such credit support.Indemnifications We have indemnified, subject to certain deductibles and limits, the purchasers of businesses or divested assets for the occurrence of specified events under certain of our divestiture agreements. Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Since the obligated amounts of these types of indemnifications are often not explicitly stated and/or are contingent on the occurrence of future events, the overall maximum amount of Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q37Table of Contents                                  the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not historically made significant payments for these indemnifications. Additionally, under certain of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial targets are achieved post-closing. We have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on an estimate of the fair value of these contingencies at the time of acquisition. Contingent obligations related to indemnifications arising from our divestitures and contingent consideration provided for by our acquisitions are not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Note 20 – Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent DevelopmentsPending Litigation Relating to the Fuji TransactionRefer to Note 19 - Contingencies and Litigation for discussion of the Pending Litigation Relating to the Fuji Xerox Transaction.Fuji Xerox Transaction Overview and Termination of AgreementOn January 31, 2018, Xerox entered into (i) a Redemption Agreement with FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, a Japanese company (“Fujifilm”), and Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., a Japanese company, in which Xerox indirectly holds a 25% equity interest while Fujifilm holds the remaining 75% equity interest (“Fuji Xerox”), and (ii) a Subscription Agreement with Fujifilm (collectively, the “Transaction Agreements”). Under the terms of the Transaction Agreements, Fuji Xerox would have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox, Xerox shareholders would have received a $2.5 billion special cash dividend and Xerox would have become owned 49.9% by Xerox's shareholders as of the closing date for the transaction and 50.1% by Fujifilm.  The terms of the Subscription Agreement provided the Company with certain terminations rights, including (a) if the audited financial statements of FX deviated in any material respect from the unaudited financial statements of FX and its subsidiaries provided to the Company prior to the date of the Subscription Agreement and (b) if Fujifilm or FX failed to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in the Subscription Agreement that would cause certain conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreement not to be satisfied, which breach or failure to perform could not be cured or, if capable of cure, had not been cured by the earlier of 30 days following written notice thereof from the Company to Fujifilm. As a result of the failure by Fujifilm to deliver the audited financial statements of FX by April 15, 2018 and the material deviations reflected in the audited financial statements of FX, when delivered, the Company determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to terminate the Subscription Agreement in accordance with the termination rights set forth therein, taking into account other circumstances limiting the ability of the Company, Fujifilm and FX to consummate a transaction. On May 13, 2018, prior to entry into the Settlement Agreement discussed in Note 19 - Contingencies and Litigation, the Company delivered written notice of termination of the Subscription Agreement to Fujifilm. By virtue of the termination of the Subscription Agreement, the Redemption Agreement terminated automatically. The Company's termination of the Transaction Agreements is the subject of pending litigation.The Company continues to maintain existing commercial relationships with FX and Fujifilm, including, as part of the following agreements: (i) the Joint Enterprise Contract, between the Company and Fujifilm, dated March 30, 2001, (ii) the Technology Agreement, dated April 1, 2006, by and between the Company and FX and (iii) the Master Program Agreement made and entered into as of September 9, 2013 by and between the Company and FX. On June 25, 2018, the Company disclosed to Fujifilm that it does not currently plan to renew the Technology Agreement when it expires in 2021. In addition, the Company disclosed plans that it may sell products directly into the Asia-Pacific market with sole and exclusive use of the Xerox brand name. Xerox’s goals include sourcing products, parts and supplies from the most competitive suppliers to support the needs of its customers. Bridge Facility TerminationOn January 31, 2018, Xerox entered into a Commitment Letter with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., which provided a commitment for a $2.5 billion unsecured bridge loan facility that would have been available for Xerox to pay the special one-time cash dividend of $2.5 billion to existing shareholders of Xerox in connection with the Transaction Agreements, as described above.Concurrent with the termination of the Transaction Agreements, the commitment to provide the unsecured bridge loan facility was terminated in the second quarter 2018 and, as a result, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of $16 were written-off. Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q38Table of Contents                                  ITEM 2 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Xerox Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes.Throughout this document, references to “we,” “our,” the “company,” and “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its subsidiaries. References to “Xerox Corporation” refer to the stand-alone parent company and do not include its subsidiaries.Currency ImpactTo better understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. The constant currency impact for signings growth is calculated on the basis of plan currency rates.OverviewFuji Xerox Transaction and Recent DevelopmentsRefer to Note 19 - Contingencies and Litigation and Note 20 - Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this terminated transaction and related matters.Fuji Xerox AdjustmentsAs previously disclosed, in April 2017 Fujifilm publicly announced it had formed an independent investigation committee ("IIC") to conduct a review of the appropriateness of the accounting practices at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand subsidiary related to the recovery of receivables associated with certain bundled leasing transactions that occurred in, or prior to, Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year ending March 31, 2016. The IIC’s review, completed during the second quarter 2017, identified total aggregate adjustments to Fuji Xerox's financial statements of approximately JPY 40 billion (approximately $360 million based on the Yen/U.S. Dollar spot exchange rate at March 31, 2017 of 111.89). The adjustments identified by the IIC primarily related to misstatements at Fuji Xerox's New Zealand subsidiary as well as their Australian subsidiary and certain other adjustments. We determined that our cumulative share of the total aggregate adjustments identified as part of the investigation was approximately $90 million and affected our fiscal years 2009 through 2017. In the second quarter 2017, we revised our previously issued annual consolidated financial statements for 2015 and 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. As a result of the IIC’s findings and recommendations, Fuji Xerox began the process of implementing improved management controls, an entity level monitoring system for financial statements of subsidiaries, and oversight and governance policies, practices and procedures.In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified.  These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and are incremental to the items identified by the IIC noted above. These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments. In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries and are further evidence of inadequate management oversight and an insufficient entity level monitoring system for financial statements of subsidiaries beyond what was previously identified by the IIC. Fuji Xerox is committed to implementing additional measures to remediate these newly identified issues. Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q39Table of Contents                                  Fuji Xerox recorded a cumulative charge of JPY 12 billion (approximately $110 million based on the Yen/U.S. Dollar average exchange rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of 108.07) in their net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (our first quarter 2018) related to the correction of these additional adjustments and misstatements. Our recognition of 25% of Fuji Xerox’s net loss for Xerox’s first quarter 2018 included an approximately $28 million charge related to these adjustments and misstatements. We determined that the impact of the out-of-period misstatements was not material to Xerox’s consolidated financial statements for any individual prior quarter or year and the adjustment to correct the misstatements is not expected to be material to our full year 2018 results. Refer to Note 9 - Investments in Affiliates, at Equity in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Third Quarter 2018 ReviewTotal revenue of $2.35 billion for third quarter 2018 declined 5.8% from third quarter 2017 and included a 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. Post sale revenue, which primarily reflects contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing, was $1.84 billion and represented 78% of total revenue. Post sale revenue declined 6.4% from third quarter 2017 and included a 1.2-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decline in post sale revenue primarily reflected the continuing lower page volume trends, an ongoing competitive price environment, a lower population of devices and lower supplies revenue. The lower population of devices is partly due to the loss of market share for multiple quarters leading up to the ConnectKey launch. These declines were partially offset by higher revenues from our partner print services offering and higher paper sales in developing markets. Total equipment revenue of $511 million decreased 3.8%, including a 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decline of total equipment revenue primarily reflected the impact of lower high-end sales and price declines of approximately 5%. These declines were partially offset by higher sales of our ConnectKey devices and demand for our recently launched Iridesse production press and higher sales through our Enterprise channel in the U.S. Total revenue of $7.30 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 declined 2.9% from the prior year period and included a 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency. Post sale revenue of $5.73 billion, which represented 78% of total revenue, declined 3.2% and included a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline in post sale revenue primarily reflected continuing lower page volume trends, an ongoing competitive price environment, a lower population of devices, as well as the higher mix of installs of lower usage devices. These declines were partially offset by higher revenues from our Global Imaging business as well as higher paper sales. Total equipment revenue of $1.57 billion declined 1.8% including a 1.3-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline of total equipment revenue reflected the impact of lower OEM sales, lower revenue from our iGen and high-end black-and white systems and price declines of approximately 5%. These declines were partially offset by higher sales of our ConnectKey devices and higher revenues from our Global Imaging business and developing markets.Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions) 2018 2017 B/(W) 2018 2017 B/(W)Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox $89 $176 $(87) $224 $388 $(164)Adjusted(1) Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox  222 234 (12) 613 634 (21)The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily due to lower revenues and higher Income tax expense, which included an additional charge of $95 million in third quarter 2018 related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). These impacts were partially offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements and lower non-service retirement-related costs. The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was also partially offset by lower Transaction and related costs, net, primarily due to recoveries during third quarter 2018. The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was negatively impacted by Transaction and related costs, net and lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included our share of a significant restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox in the first quarter of 2018. Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q40Table of Contents                                  The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily related to lower revenues and higher income tax expense, partially offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements. The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was partially offset by higher Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, while adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was negatively impacted by lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included an out-of-period adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2018.Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by a potential increase in the cost of our products as a result of new or incremental trade protection measures such as, increased import tariffs, import or export restrictions and requirements and the revocation or material modification of trade agreements.  We are currently evaluating the impact of potentially new import tariffs on our products, which could significantly increase their cost. We are continuing to monitor developments in this area and will make efforts to mitigate the impact to the extent possible.  Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $725 million, as compared to a use of cash of $30 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the prior year voluntary contributions of $500 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and the reclassification of $170 million of collections of deferred proceeds and beneficial interests from the sale of receivables to investing cash flows as a result of an accounting change in the prior year (refer to Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Operating cash flows also increased due to improved working capital2 as well as lower other pension contributions. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $40 million and included capital expenditures of $73 million, which were partially offset by proceeds of $32 million from the sale of non-core business assets.

In prior periods, this revenue was reported within Services, maintenance and rentals.(2)Refer to the "Geographic Sales Channels and Product and Offerings Definitions" section.(3)Excluding Equipment revenue, Managed Document Services (MDS) was $724 million and $744 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of 2.7% including a 1.5-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, excluding Equipment revenue, MDS was $2,229 million and $2,194 million, respectively, representing an increase of 1.6% including a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact from currency.Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 5.8% as compared to third quarter 2017, with a 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, while total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 2.9% as compared to the prior year period, with a 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency. Total revenue reflected the following:Post sale revenue primarily reflects contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing. These revenues are associated not only with the population of devices in the field, which is affected by installs and removals, but also by the page volumes generated by the usage of such devices, and the revenue per printed page. Post sale revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 6.4% as compared to third quarter 2017, with a 1.2-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, while Post sale revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 3.2% as compared to the prior year period, with a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact from currency. Post sale revenue reflected the following:•Services, maintenance and rentals revenue includes rental and maintenance revenue (including bundled supplies) as well as the post sale component of the document services revenue from our Managed Document Services (MDS) offerings, and revenues from our Communication and Marketing Solutions (CMS). Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q42Table of Contents                                  ◦For the three months ended September 30, 2018 Service, maintenance and rentals revenues decreased 6.9% as compared to third quarter 2017, with a 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decline at constant currency1 reflected the continuing trends of lower page volumes (including a higher mix of lower usage products), an ongoing competitive price environment, and a lower population of devices, which are partially associated with continued lower signings and lower installs in prior periods. These declines were partially mitigated by higher revenues from our partner print services offering.◦For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 Service, maintenance and rentals revenues decreased 3.8% as compared to the prior year period, with a 1.2-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline at constant currency1 reflected the continuing trends of lower page volumes (including a higher mix of lower usage products), an ongoing competitive price environment and a lower population of devices, which are partially associated with continued lower signings and installs in prior periods. The lower population of devices is partly due to the loss of market share for multiple quarters leading up to the ConnectKey launch. These impacts are partially offset by higher revenues from MDS, our Global Imaging business (inclusive of acquisitions), and our developing markets. •Supplies, paper and other sales includes unbundled supplies and other sales. ◦For the three months ended September 30, 2018 Supplies paper and other sales decreased 6.3% as compared to third quarter 2017, including a 1.4-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decline at constant currency1 was driven by lower supplies revenues and lower network integration sales, while paper increased as a result of higher sales in developing markets. The decline also included an approximate 1.3-percentage point impact from lower OEM sales.◦For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 Supplies paper and other sales decreased 2.7% as compared to the prior year period, with a 0.4-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline at constant currency1 was driven by lower supplies and lower network integration and software licensing sales, partially offset by higher paper sales and supplies sales within our Global Imaging business. The decline also included an approximate 1.6-percentage point impact from lower OEM sales.•Financing revenue is generated from financed equipment sale transactions. For the three months ended September 30, 2018 Financing revenue decreased 11.0% compared to third quarter 2017, with a 1.2-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, while Financing revenue decreased 8.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the prior year period, with a 2.0-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decrease in these revenues reflected a declining finance receivables balance due to lower financed equipment sales in prior periods.

This reclassification was made to provide better transparency to our business results. Prior year amounts have been adjusted to conform to this change. (2)In 2018, upon adoption of ASU 2014-09 Revenue Recognition, revenue from training related to equipment installation is now included in Equipment sales (previously included in Post sale revenue). Prior year amounts have been adjusted to conform to this change.Equipment sales revenue decreased 3.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to third quarter 2017, with a 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, while equipment sales revenue decreased 1.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the prior year period, with a 1.3-percentage point favorable impact from currency. Both periods were impacted by price declines of approximately 5% (which were in-line with our historic declines). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decline at constant currency1 included a 4.5-percentage point and a 3.4-percentage point impact, respectively, from lower OEM equipment sales.•Entry - For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the increase in both periods, compared to their respective prior year periods, reflected higher sales of our ConnectKey devices in developing markets and U.S. indirect channels.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q43Table of Contents                                  •Mid-range - For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the increase in both periods, compared to their respective prior year periods, reflected higher sales through our Enterprise channel in the U.S., as well as higher sales of lower-end devices in developing markets. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the increase was partially offset by lower revenues from indirect channels and from our Global Imaging business, while for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the increase was also attributed to higher sales from our Global Imaging business. •High-end - For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease primarily reflected lower revenues from iGen in the U.S. along with lower revenues from black-and-white systems consistent with market decline trends. These declines were only partially mitigated by demand for the recently launched Iridesse production press. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease was also attributed to lower installs of the Versant systems (partially as a result of lapping the prior year launch).Total InstallsInstalls reflect new placement of devices only. Revenue associated with equipment installations (discussed below) may be reflected up-front in Equipment sales or over time either through rental income or as part of our Managed Document Services revenues (which are both reported within our post sale revenues), depending on the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers. Install activity includes Managed Document Services and Xerox-branded products shipped to Global Imaging business.

The reduction reflected primarily productivity and restructuring savings associated with our business transformation actions. These improvements were partially offset by $34 million of charges related to the accelerated depreciation from the early termination of a capital lease associated with a surplus facility ($22 million) and the cancellation of certain IT projects ($12 million). Bad debt expense of $35 million increased $5 million compared to the prior year period and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of receivables.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q47Table of Contents                                  Restructuring and Related CostsThird quarter 2018 Restructuring and related costs of $29 million included $40 million of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 900 employees worldwide and $1 million of lease cancellation costs. The average restructuring cost per employee was lower in third quarter 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to reductions in our employee severance programs particularly with respect to actions in the U.S. These costs were partially offset by $12 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives. Third quarter 2018 actions impacted several functional areas, with approximately 30% focused on gross margin improvements, approximately 65% on SAG reductions and the remainder focused on RD&E optimization.Restructuring and related costs were $91 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and included $104 million of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 1,850 employees worldwide and $13 million of lease cancellation costs partially offset by $26 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.Third quarter 2017 Restructuring and related costs of $35 million included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $34 million as well as $1 million of additional costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program. Third quarter 2017 net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $34 million included $39 million of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 600 employees worldwide. These costs were partially offset by $5 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives. The third quarter 2017 actions impacted several functional areas, with approximately 80% focused on SAG reductions and approximately 20% focused on gross margin improvements. Restructuring and related costs were $192 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $174 million as well as $18 million of additional costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program. Net restructuring and asset impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 of $174 million included $196 million of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 2,100 employees worldwide and $3 million of lease cancellation costs partially offset by $25 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives, which included a $5 million favorable adjustment on the early termination of the lease for the corporate airplane.The restructuring reserve balance as of September 30, 2018 for all programs was $70 million, of which $67 million is expected to be spent over the next twelve months. Refer to Note 10 - Restructuring Programs in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.Transaction and Related Costs, NetWe recorded $63 million of Transaction and related costs, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, which included the following:•Costs related to the proposed combination transaction with Fuji Xerox, which was terminated in May 2018, primarily for third-party accounting, legal, consulting and other similar types of services. •Costs related to the settlement agreement reached with certain shareholders in the second quarter of 2018 as well as third-party legal and other related costs associated with on-going litigation resulting from the terminated combination transaction and other related shareholder actions. •$19 million of costs related to the commitment for a $2.5 billion unsecured bridge loan facility, which was terminated concurrent with the termination of the Fuji Xerox combination transaction.•Recoveries of approximately $45 million, which included insurance recoveries for litigation and related settlement costs of approximately $30 million and a settlement refund from a financial adviser, associated with the terminated combination transaction, for approximately $13 million. We continue to pursue additional recoveries from insurance carriers and other parties for costs and expenses related to the terminated transaction and shareholder litigation and therefore additional recoveries and adjustments may be recorded in future periods, when finalized. Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $36 million was $5 million lower compared to the prior year period. Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q48Table of Contents                                  Worldwide EmploymentWorldwide employment was approximately 33,200 as of September 30, 2018 and decreased by approximately 2,100 from December 31, 2017, largely driven by our business transformation. Approximately half of the reduction was associated with restructuring actions, while the remainder resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), of which a large portion is not expected to be backfilled.Other Expenses, Net Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended                                           September 30,(in millions)2018 2017 2018 2017Non-financing interest expense$28 $29 $84 $89Non-service retirement-related costs33 35 83 129Interest income(5) (2) (12) (6)Gains on sales of businesses and assets(3) (13) (35) (14)Currency losses, net3 — 2 4Loss on sales of accounts receivable1 3 2 9Loss on early extinguishment of debt— — — 13All other expenses, net— — 2 10Other expenses, net$57 $52 $126 $234Non-Financing Interest ExpenseNon-financing interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $28 million and was $1 million lower than third quarter of 2017. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $1 million from third quarter of 2017 due to a lower debt balance, partially offset by higher average interest rates.Non-financing interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $84 million and was $5 million lower as compared to the prior year period. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $4 million from the prior year comparable period primarily due to a lower debt balance reflecting debt repayments of approximately $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2017 partially offset by $1.0 billion of new debt issued in the third quarter 2017 to fund, among other things, a $500 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, partially offset by higher average interest rates.Non-Service Retirement-Related CostsNon-service retirement-related costs decreased $2 million and $46 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year periods. Both period decreases were primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher pension contributions and asset returns in the prior year, with the decrease in third quarter 2018 partially offset by higher losses from pension settlements in the U.S.Gains on Sales of Businesses and AssetsGains on sales of businesses and assets decreased $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to third quarter 2017, reflecting primarily the prior year sale of a research facility in Grenoble, France (which primarily supported the discontinued BPO business). Gains on the sales of business and assets increased $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year period, reflecting a higher level of sales of non-core business assets in 2018.Loss on Early Extinguishment of DebtDuring the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a $13 million loss associated with the repayment of $300 million in Senior Notes.Income TaxesThird quarter 2018 effective tax rate was 74.0% and includes an additional charge of $95 million related to a change in the provisional estimated impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") as discussed below. On an adjusted1 basis, third quarter 2018 effective tax rate was 24.5%. This rate was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the geographical mix of profits. The adjusted1 effective tax rate excludes the tax benefits associated with the following charges: Restructuring and related costs, Amortization of intangible assets, Transaction and related costs, net, non-service retirement-related costs and the impact of the Tax Act as discussed below.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q49Table of Contents                                  The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 47.9% and includes an additional charge of $95 million related to a change in the provisional estimated impact from the 2017 Tax Act as discussed below. On an adjusted1 basis, the nine months ended September 30, 2018 effective tax rate was 26.5%. This rate was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the geographical mix of profits. The adjusted1 effective tax rate excludes the tax benefits associated with the following charges: Restructuring and related costs, Amortization of intangible assets, Transaction and related costs, net, non-service retirement-related costs and the impact associated with the 2017 Tax Act, as discussed below.Third quarter 2017 effective tax rate was 10.8%. On an adjusted1 basis, third quarter 2017 effective tax rate was 19.3%. Both rates were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to the redetermination of certain unrecognized tax positions upon conclusion of several audits. The adjusted1 effective tax rate excludes the tax benefits associated with the following charges: Restructuring and related costs, Amortization of intangible assets and non-service retirement-related costs. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was 10.8%. On an adjusted1 basis, the nine months ended September 30, 2017 effective tax rate was 24.3%. Both rates were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to foreign tax credits, the redetermination of certain unrecognized tax positions upon conclusion of several audits and the geographic mix of profits. The adjusted1 effective tax rate excludes the majority of the benefit from the re-measurement of certain unrecognized tax positions as well as the tax benefits associated with the following charges: Restructuring and related costs, Amortization of intangible assets, non-service retirement-related costs and other discrete items. Our effective tax rate is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our effective tax rate will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events that may not be predictable. ______________(1)Refer to the Effective Tax Rate reconciliation table in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”)On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.During the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded an estimated non-cash charge of $400 million reflecting our provisional estimated impact associated with the provisions of the Tax Act based on currently available information. Our estimated charge incorporated assumptions based on our current interpretation of the Tax Act as well as information available at that time and was subject to change, possibly materially, as we completed our analysis and received additional clarification and implementation guidance. During third quarter 2018 we adjusted our provisional estimate by an additional charge of $95 million reflecting certain positions taken on our recently filed 2017 income tax return as well as consideration of additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The adjustment includes changes to the determination of the one-time deemed repatriation tax as well as additional re-measurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted statutory tax rate. The total charge of $495 million related to the Tax Act remains a provisional estimate as we continue to evaluate and consider additional impacts including those related to interpretive guidance from the U.S. Treasury and IRS as well as filing positions we may take on our 2018 U.S. Tax Return.  Accordingly, additional adjustments may be recorded, possibly material, in the fourth quarter 2018 as we finalize our estimate related to the Tax Act.  Any adjustments to this provisional amount will be reported as a component of Income tax expense.Effective January 1, 2018, we became subject to several provisions of the Tax Act including computations related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ("GILTI"), Foreign Derived Intangible Income ("FDII"), Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax ("BEAT"), and IRC Section 163(j) interest limitation (Interest Limitation). Our current estimate for the GILTI, FDII and Interest Limitation rules was determined to be immaterial, however we currently estimate that we are subject to BEAT.  Accordingly, our third quarter and year to date 2018 effective tax rate includes the estimated impact for BEAT, which has also been incorporated into our estimated annual effective tax for 2018. Similar to the provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 associated with the enactment of the Tax Act, the estimates for these additional provisions of the Tax Act were made based on our current interpretation of the Tax Act as well as currently available information and may change, as we complete our analysis and receive additional clarification and implementation guidance. Changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act may also impact these estimates.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q50Table of Contents                                  Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Unconsolidated Affiliates  Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended                                           September 30,(in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017Total Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates $43 $30 $(6) $90Fuji Xerox after-tax restructuring and other charges included in equity income (loss) 7 6 90 9Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox Net income (loss).

There were no borrowings under our Credit Facility or Commercial Paper Program at September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017, respectively. We have narrowed our full year guidance range for 2018 operating cash flows from continuing operations to be between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, from our original guidance of between $900 million and $1.1 billion, partly due to lower expected pension contributions. Additionally, we have lowered our full year 2018 capital expenditures expectation to be approximately $100 million, from our original expectation of $150 million. We continue to expect dividend payments to common shareholders to be approximately $260 million.

The $755 million increase in operating cash from the prior year period was primarily due to the following:•$29 million increase in pre-tax income before Transaction and related costs, net, Depreciation and amortization, Net gain on sales of businesses and assets, Restructuring and asset impairment charges and Defined benefit pension cost.•$606 million increase due to contributions of $635 million in third quarter 2017 to our domestic tax-qualified defined benefit plans, which includes an incremental voluntary contribution of $500 million.•$211 million increase from accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of collections and lower revenue, as well as the prior year reclassification of $157 million of collections of deferred proceeds from the sales of accounts receivables to investing.•$96 million increase from inventory due in part to the timing of the product launch in the prior year.•$35 million increase from lower restructuring payments.•$55 million decrease due to lower net run-off of finance receivables of $28 million and higher equipment on operating leases of $27 million.•$40 million decrease from Accounts payable primarily related to the year-over-year timing of supplier and vendor payments.•$41 million decrease due to net payments for transaction and related costs.•$41 million decrease primarily related to the prior year settlements of foreign currency derivative contracts associated with intercompany borrowings.•$31 million decrease in dividends received from equity investments primarily due to lower income from Fuji Xerox.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $40 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The $59 million decrease in cash from the prior year period was primarily due to the following:•$157 million decrease is primarily a result of the termination of certain accounts receivables sales arrangements in fourth quarter 2017.•$20 million decrease due to the prior year sale of a research facility in Grenoble, France.•$76 million increase due to no acquisitions in 2018.•$30 million increase primarily from the sale of non-core business assets in 2018.Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q53Table of Contents                                  Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $815 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

This program replaced the $245 million of authority remaining under the Company's previously authorized share repurchase program. In third quarter 2018, the Company increased its expectation for share repurchases in 2018 from an original expectation of up to $500 million of shares to an updated expectation of up to $700 million of shares. In third quarter 2018, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $284 million, including fees. There were no share repurchases in the first or second quarter of 2018. Through October 31, 2018, we repurchased an additional 6.9 million in shares with an aggregate cost of $182 million, including fees, for a cumulative total of 17.4 million shares at a cost of $466 million, including fees.Refer to Note 16 - Shareholders' Equity, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our share repurchase program.Financial Risk ManagementWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge economic exposures, as well as to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. We enter into limited types of derivative contracts, including interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency spot, forward and swap contracts and net purchased foreign currency options to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Our primary foreign currency market exposures include the Japanese Yen, Euro and U.K. Pound Sterling. The fair market values of all our derivative contracts change with fluctuations in interest rates and/or currency exchange rates and are designed so that any changes in their values are offset by changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Derivative financial instruments are held solely as risk Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q55Table of Contents                                  management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes. The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet.  As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment. Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges. These derivative contracts are likewise required to be recognized each period at fair value and therefore do result in some level of volatility. The level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding, as well as fluctuations in the currency and interest rate markets during the period. The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties.The current market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. Refer to Note 12 – Financial Instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and information on our financial risk management strategies.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results.  Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects.A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth below as well as in the third quarter 2018 presentation slides available at www.xerox.com/investor.These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.Adjusted Earnings Measures•Net income and Earnings per share (EPS)•Effective tax rateThe above measures were adjusted for the following items:Amortization of intangible assets: The amortization of intangible assets is driven by our acquisition activity, which can vary in size, nature and timing as compared to other companies within our industry and from period to period. The use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.Restructuring and related costs: Restructuring and related costs include restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as costs associated with our strategic transformation program beyond those normally included in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Restructuring consists of costs primarily related to severance and benefits paid to employees pursuant to formal restructuring and workforce reduction plans. Asset impairment includes costs incurred for those assets sold, abandoned or made obsolete as a result of our restructuring actions, exiting from a business or other strategic business changes. Additional costs for our strategic transformation program are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives and include third-party professional service costs as well as one-time incremental costs. All of these costs can vary significantly in terms of amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of the business. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we will exclude these charges since we do not believe they provide meaningful insight into our current or past operating performance nor do we believe they are reflective of our expected future operating expenses as such charges are expected to yield future benefits and savings with respect to our operational performance.Non-service retirement-related costs: Our defined benefit pension and retiree health costs include several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q56Table of Contents                                  as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to employees who are no longer providing current service to the Company (e.g. retirees and ex-employees). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains/losses and (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments. Accordingly, we consider these elements of our periodic retirement plan costs to be outside the operational performance of the business or legacy costs and not necessarily indicative of current or future cash flow requirements. This approach is consistent with the classification of these costs as non-operating in Other expenses, net as a result of our adoption of ASU 2017-07 - Reporting of Retirement Related Benefit Costs in 2018. Adjusted earnings will continue to include the service cost elements of our retirement costs, which is related to current employee service as well as the cost of our defined contribution plans.Transaction and related costs, net: Transaction and related costs, net are expenses incurred in connection with Xerox's planned combination transaction with Fuji Xerox, which was terminated in May 2018, as well as, costs and expenses related to the previously disclosed settlement agreement reached with certain shareholders and litigation related to the terminated transaction and other shareholder actions. These costs are considered incremental to our normal operating charges and were incurred or are expected to be incurred solely as a result of the planned combination transaction and the related shareholder settlement agreement and litigation. Accordingly, we are excluding these expenses from our Adjusted Earnings Measures in order to evaluate our performance on a comparable basis.Restructuring and other charges - Fuji Xerox:  We also adjust our 25% share of Fuji Xerox’s Net income (loss) for similar items noted above such as Restructuring and related costs and Transaction and related costs, net based on the same rationale discussed above.Other discrete, unusual or infrequent items: In addition, we also excluded the following items given their discrete, unusual or infrequent nature and their impact on our results for the period:•2017 - Loss on early extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2017.•2017 - A benefit from the remeasurement of a tax matter in the first quarter of 2017 that related to a previously adjusted item.•2018 - An additional charge in the third quarter of 2018 related to a change in the provisional estimated impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). See the "Income Taxes" section in the MD&A for further information.We believe the exclusion of these items allows investors to better understand and analyze the results for the period as compared to prior periods and expected future trends in our business.Adjusted Operating Income and MarginWe also calculate and utilize adjusted operating income and margin measures by adjusting our reported pre-tax income and margin amounts. In addition to the costs and expenses noted as adjustments for our Adjusted Earnings measures, adjusted operating income and margin also exclude the remaining amounts included in Other expenses, net, which are primarily non-financing interest expense and certain other non-operating costs and expenses. We exclude these amounts in order to evaluate our current and past operating performance and to better understand the expected future trends in our business. Adjusted Operating income and margin also include Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox's Net income (loss). We include this amount in our measure of operating income and margin as Fuji Xerox is our primary product supplier and intermediary to the Asia/Pacific market for distribution of Xerox branded products and services.Constant Currency (CC)Refer to "Currency Impact" for a discussion of this measure and its use in our analysis of revenue growth. SummaryManagement believes that all of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period’s results against the corresponding prior period’s results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth on the following tables:Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q57Table of Contents                                  Net Income and EPS reconciliation:  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,  2018 2017 2018 2017(in millions, except per share amounts) Net  Income  EPS Net  Income EPS Net  Income  EPS Net Income EPSReported(1) $89 $0.34 $176 $0.67 $224 $0.83 $388 $1.47Adjustments:                Restructuring and related costs 29   35   91   192  Amortization of intangible assets 12   12   36   41  Transaction and related costs, net (33)   —   63   —  Non-service retirement-related costs 33   35   83   129  Loss on early extinguishment of debt —   —   —   13  Income tax on adjustments(2) (10)   (30)   (69)   (122)  Tax Act 95   —   95   —  Remeasurement of unrecognized tax positions —   —   —   (16)  Restructuring and other charges -
